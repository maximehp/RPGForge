              your adventuring companions can expect to receive free healing and
              care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence of your
              faith, though you must provide any material components needed for
              spells. Those who share your religion will support you (but only
              you) at a modest lifestyle.\r

              You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your
              chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This
              could be the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good
              terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While
              near your temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance,
              provided the assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you
              remain in good standing with your temple."

              | d8 | Personality Trait |\r

              |---|---|\r

              | 1 | I idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly
              refer to that person's deeds and example. |\r

              | 2 | I can find common ground between the fiercest enemies,
              empathizing with them and always working toward peace. |\r

              | 3 | I see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak
              to us, we just need to listen |\r

              | 4 | Nothing can shake my optimistic attitude. |\r

              | 5 | I quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost
              every situation. |\r

              | 6 | I am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect
              (or condemn) the worship of other gods. |\r

              | 7 | I've enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my
              temple's elite. Rough living grates on me. |\r

              | 8 | I've spent so long in the temple that I have little
              practical experience dealing with people in the outside world. |\r

              \r

              | d6 | Ideal |\r

              |---|---|\r

              | 1 | Tradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice
              must be preserved and upheld. (Lawful) |\r

              | 2 | Charity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what
              the personal cost. (Good) |\r

              | 3 | Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are
              constantly working in the world. (Chaotic) |\r

              | 4 | Power. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith's
              religious hierarchy. (Lawful) |\r

              | 5 | Faith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have
              faith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful) |\r

              | 6 | Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god's favor
              by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any) |\r

              \r

              | d6 | Bond |\r

              |---|---|\r

              | 1 | I would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was
              lost long ago. |\r

              | 2 | I will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy
              who branded me a heretic. |\r

              | 3 | I owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents
              died. |\r

              | 4 | Everything I do is for the common people. |\r

              | 5 | I will do anything to protect the temple where I served. |\r

              | 6 | I seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider
              heretical and seek to destroy. |\r

              \r

              | d6 | Flaw |\r

              |---|---|\r

              | 1 | I judge others harshly, and myself even more severely. |\r

              | 2 | I put too much trust in those who wield power within my
              temple's hierarchy. |\r

              | 3 | My piety sometimes leads me to blindly trust those that
              profess faith in my god. |\r

              | 4 | I am inflexible in my thinking. |\r

              | 5 | I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
              |\r

              | 6 | Once I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the
              detriment of everything else in my life. |"

        desc: "You have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific god or
          pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the realm of the
          holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and offering
          sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence of the
          divine. You are not necessarily a cleric performing sacred rites is
          not the same thing as channeling divine power.\r

          \r

          Choose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being
          from among those listed in \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" or those
          specified by your GM, and work with your GM to detail the nature of
          your religious service. Were you a lesser functionary in a temple,
          raised from childhood to assist the priests in the sacred rites? Or
          were you a high priest who suddenly experienced a call to serve your
          god in a different way? Perhaps you were the leader of a small cult
          outside of any established temple structure, or even an occult group
          that served a fiendish master that you now deny."
