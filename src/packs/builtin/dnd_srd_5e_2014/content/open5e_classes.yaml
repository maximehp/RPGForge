              unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven't attacked a
              hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then.
              You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\r

              tune to different situations.\r

              \r

              ###Cantrips\r

              \r

              You know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You
              learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as
              shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.\r

              \r

              ###Spell Slots\r

              \r

              The Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r

              \r

              For example, if you know the 1st-level spell cure wounds and have
              a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast
              cure wounds using either slot.\r

              \r

              ###Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\r

              \r

              You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the bard spell
              list.\r

              \r

              The Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn
              more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a
              level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For
              instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn
              one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\r

              \r

              Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose
              one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell
              from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which
              you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              ###Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your
              magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance
              of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell
              refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
              Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard
              spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              *Spell save DC* = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              \r

              *Spell attack modifier* = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              \r

              ###Ritual Casting\r

              \r

              You can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has
              the ritual tag.\r

              \r

              ###Spellcasting Focus\r

              \r

              You can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a
              spellcasting focus for your bard spells."

              ### Channel Divinity: Turn Undead\r

              \r

              As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer
              censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within
              30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature
              fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it
              takes any damage.\r

              \r

              A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
              from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within
              30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it
              can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
              prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature
              can use the Dodge action."

            desc: "As a conduit for divine power, you can cast cleric spells.\r

              \r

              ###Cantrips\r

              \r

              At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the
              cleric spell list. You learn additional cleric cantrips of your
              choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
              the Cleric table.\r

              Preparing and Casting Spells\r

              \r

              The Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r

              \r

              You prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you
              to cast, choosing from the cleric spell list. When you do so,
              choose a number of cleric spells equal to your Wisdom modifier +
              your cleric level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a
              level for which you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              For example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four
              1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your
              list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
              wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot.
              Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
              spells.\r

              \r

              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of cleric spells requires time spent in
              prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each
              spell on your list.\r

              \r

              ###Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The
              power of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You
              use your Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your
              spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier
              when setting the saving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and
              when making an attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
              modifier\r

              \r

              **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
              modifier\r

              \r

              ###Ritual Casting\r

              \r

              You can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\r

              \r

              ###Spellcasting Focus\r

              \r

              You can use a holy symbol (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a
              spellcasting focus for your cleric spells."

            desc: "Drawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells to
              shape that essence to your will.\r

              \r

              ###Cantrips\r

              \r

              At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the druid
              spell list. You learn additional druid cantrips of your choice at
              higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Druid
              table.\r

              \r

              ###Preparing and Casting Spells\r

              \r

              The Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,
              you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
              all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r

              \r

              You prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to
              cast, choosing from the druid spell list. When you do so, choose a
              number of druid spells equal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid
              level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for
              which you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              For example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level
              and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of
              prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any
              combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you
              can cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell
              doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.\r

              \r

              You can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a
              long rest. Preparing a new list of druid spells requires time
              spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level
              for each spell on your list.\r

              \r

              ###Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since
              your magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You
              use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
              ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting
              the saving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an
              attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
              modifier\r

              \r

              **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
              modifier\r

              \r

              ###Ritual Casting\r

              \r

              You can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the
              ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.\r

              \r

              ###Spellcasting Focus\r

              \r

              You can use a druidic focus (see chapter 5, “Equipment”) as a
              spellcasting focus for your druid spells."

            desc: "Starting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume the
              shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this
              feature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a short or
              long rest.\r

              \r

              Your druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as
              shown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you
              can transform into any beast that has a challenge rating of 1/4 or
              lower that doesn't have a flying or swimming speed.\r

              \r

              | Level | Max. CR | Limitations | Example |\r

              | --- | --- | --- | --- |\r

              | 2nd | 1/4 | No flying or swimming speed | Wolf |\r

              | 4th | 1/2 | No flying speed | Crocodile |\r

              | 8th | 1 | - | Giant Eagle |\r

              \r

              You can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half
              your druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal
              form unless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert
              to your normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn.
              You automatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit
              points, or die.\r

              \r

              While you are transformed, the following rules apply:\r

              Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast,
              but you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence,
              Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and
              saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the
              creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the
              bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's
              bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair
              actions, you can't use them.\r

              \r

              When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit
              Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the
              number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if
              you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess
              damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take
              10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you
              revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't
              reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked
              unconscious.\r

              \r

              You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any
              action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your
              beast form. Transforming doesn't break your concentration on a
              spell you've already cast, however, or prevent you from taking
              actions that are part of a spell, such as call lightning, that
              you've already cast.\r

              \r

              You retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or
              other source and can use them if the new form is physically
              capable of doing so. However, you can't use any of your special
              senses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that
              sense.\r

              \r

              You choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your
              space, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment
              functions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical
              for the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the
              creature's shape and size. Your equipment doesn't change size or
              shape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form
              can't wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.
              Equipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave
              the form."

              strike or monk weapon. This die changes as you gain monk levels,

              * When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk
              weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus
              action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with

              turn. \r

              \r

              Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For

              connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a

              **Sacred Weapon.** As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you
              are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity. For
              1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with
              that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits
              bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond
              that. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for
              the duration.\r

              \r

              You can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action.
              If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you
              fall unconscious, this effect ends.\r

              \r

              **Turn the Unholy.** As an action, you present your holy symbol
              and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel
              Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30
              feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
              its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes
              damage.\r

              \r

              A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away
              from you as it can, and it can't willingly move to a space within
              30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it
              can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that
              prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature
              can use the Dodge action."

              committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose the
              Oath of Devotion, the Oath of the Ancients, or the Oath of
              Vengeance, all detailed at the end of the class description.\r

              ### Channel Divinity\r

              \r

              Your oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical
              effects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath
              explains how to use it.\r

              \r

              When you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to
              use. You must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel
              Divinity again.\r

              \r

              Some Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use
              such an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell
              save DC."

              ### Preparing and Casting Spells\r

              \r

              The Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher,
              you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain
              all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r

              \r

              You prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you
              to cast, choosing from the paladin spell list. When you do so,
              choose a number of paladin spells equal to your Charisma modifier
              + half your paladin level, rounded down (minimum of one spell).
              The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              For example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four
              1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14,
              your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure
              wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd- level slot.
              Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared
              spells.\r

              \r

              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent
              in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for
              each spell on your list.\r

              \r

              ### Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells,
              since their power derives from the strength of your convictions.
              You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
              ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting
              the saving throw DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making
              an attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              \r

              **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              Spellcasting Focus\r

              \r

              You can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus for your paladin
              spells."

              The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r

              For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and
              have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
              cast animal friendship using either slot.\r

              You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell
              list.\r

              \r

              The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn
              more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of
              a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
              reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
              or 2nd level.\r

              \r

              Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose
              one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another
              spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level
              for which you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              ### Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since
              your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom
              whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition,
              you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for
              a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
              modifier\r

              \r

              **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom
              modifier"

              give one target of the spell disadvantage on its first saving
              throw made against the spell.\r

              spend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus
              action for this casting.\r

              \r

              ### Subtle Spell\r

              \r

              When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it
              without any somatic or verbal components.\r

              \r

              ### Twinned Spell\r

              \r

              When you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn't
              have a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points
              equal to the spell's level to target a second creature in range
              with the same spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).\r

              \r

              To be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than
              one creature at the spell's current level. For example, magic
              missile and scorching ray aren't eligible, but ray of frost and
              chromatic orb are."

            desc: "An event in your past, or in the life of a parent or ancestor, left an
              indelible mark on you, infusing you with arcane magic. This font
              of magic, whatever its origin, fuels your spells.\r

              \r

              ### Cantrips\r

              \r

              At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the
              sorcerer spell list. You learn additional sorcerer cantrips of
              your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known
              column of the Sorcerer table.\r

              \r

              ### Spell Slots\r

              \r

              The Sorcerer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast
              your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these sorcerer
              spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You
              regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r

              \r

              For example, if you know the 1st-level spell burning hands and
              have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can
              cast burning hands using either slot.\r

              \r

              ### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\r

              \r

              You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the sorcerer
              spell list.\r

              \r

              The Spells Known column of the Sorcerer table shows when you learn
              more sorcerer spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be
              of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you
              reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st
              or 2nd level.\r

              \r

              Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose
              one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another
              spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level
              for which you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              ### Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your sorcerer spells,
              since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project
              your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell
              refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your
              Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer
              spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              **Spell save DC = 8** + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              \r

              **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              Spellcasting Focus\r

              \r

              You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your
              sorcerer spells."

              Armor of Shadows\r

              \r

              You can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a
              spell slot or material components.\r

              \r

              ### Ascendant Step\r

              \r

              Prerequisite: 9th level\r

              \r

              You can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a
              spell slot or material components.\r

              \r

              ### Beast Speech\r

              \r

              You can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell
              slot.\r

              \r

              ### Beguiling Influence\r

              \r

              You gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\r

              \r

              ### Bewitching Whispers\r

              \r

              Prerequisite: 7th level\r

              \r

              You can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can't

              \r

              Prerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\r

              \r

              You can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows.
              Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any
              class's spell list (the two needn't be from the same list). The
              spells appear in the book and don't count against the number of
              spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast
              the chosen spells as rituals. You can't cast the spells except as
              rituals, unless you've learned them by some other means. You can
              also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the
              ritual tag.\r

              \r

              On your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book
              of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book
              if the spell's level is equal to or less than half your warlock
              level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the
              spell. For each level of the spell, the transcription process
              takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe
              it.\r

              \r

              ### Chains of Carceri\r

              \r

              \r

              You can cast hold monster at will-targeting a celestial, fiend, or
              elemental-without expending a spell slot or material components.
              You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on
              the same creature again.\r

              \r

              ### Devil's Sight\r

              \r

              \r

              You can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell
              slot.\r

              \r

              \r

              You can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell,
              without expending a spell slot or material components.\r

              \r

              You can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive
              through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the
              creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use
              your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection,
              extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While
              perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit from
              any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded
              and deafened to your own surroundings.\r

              \r

              ### Lifedrinker\r

            desc: "At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your
              loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your
              choice.\r

              \r

              ### Pact of the Chain\r

              \r

              You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The
              spell doesn't count against your number of spells known.\r

              \r

              When you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms
              for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp,
              pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\r

              \r

              Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one
              of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of
              its own with its reaction.\r

              \r

              ### Pact of the Blade\r

              \r

              You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty
              hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each
              time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it.
              This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming
              resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\r

              \r

              Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from
              you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this
              feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or
              if you die.\r

              \r

              You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by
              performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform
              the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a
              short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an
              extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your
              pact weapon thereafter. You can't affect an artifact or a sentient
              weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if
              you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon,
              or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon
              appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when
              the bond breaks.\r

              \r

              ### Pact of the Tome\r

              \r

              Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When
              you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class's
              spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While the
              book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They
              don't count against your number of cantrips known. If they don't
              appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock
              spells for you.\r

              \r

              If you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour
              ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony
              can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the
              previous book. The book turns to ash when you die."

              \r

              ### Cantrips\r

              \r

              You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list.
              You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher
              levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock
              table.\r

              Spell Slots\r

              \r

              The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table
              also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell
              slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of
              1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\r

              \r

              For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell
              slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one
              of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\r

              \r

              ### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher\r

              \r

              At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from
              the warlock spell list.\r

              \r

              The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn
              more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A
              spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in
              the table's Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th
              level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be
              1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\r

              \r

              Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose
              one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another
              spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level
              for which you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              ### Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so
              you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting
              ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting
              the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making
              an attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              \r

              **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma
              modifier\r

              \r

              ### Spellcasting Focus\r

              \r

              You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your
              warlock spells."

              ### Cantrips\r

              \r

              At 1st level, you know three cantrips of your choice from the
              wizard spell list. You learn additional wizard cantrips of your
              choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of
              the Wizard table.\r

              \r

              ### Spellbook\r

              \r

              At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st- level
              wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of
              the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed
              in your mind.\r

              \r

              ### Preparing and Casting Spells\r

              \r

              The Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your
              spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you
              must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all
              expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\r

              \r

              You prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you
              to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your
              spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level
              (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which
              you have spell slots.\r

              \r

              For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level
              and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your
              list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd
              level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you
              prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a
              1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it
              from your list of prepared spells.\r

              \r

              You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long
              rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent
              studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and
              gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per
              spell level for each spell on your list.\r

              \r

              ### Spellcasting Ability\r

              \r

              Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells,
              since you learn your spells through dedicated study and
              memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to
              your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence
              modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you
              cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r

              \r

              **Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence
              modifier\r

              \r

              **Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your
              Intelligence modifier\r

              \r

              ### Ritual Casting\r

              \r

              You can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the

              ### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\r

              \r

              Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells
              of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells
              must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the
              Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that
              you can add to your spellbook (see the “Your Spellbook” sidebar)."
