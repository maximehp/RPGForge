              The aboleth targets one creature it can see within 30 ft. of it.
              The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be
              magically charmed by the aboleth until the aboleth dies or until
              it is on a different plane of existence from the target. The
              charmed target is under the aboleth's control and can't take
              reactions, and the aboleth and the target can communicate
              telepathically with each other over any distance.

              Whenever the charmed target takes damage, the target can repeat
              the saving throw. On a success, the effect ends. No more than once
              every 24 hours, the target can also repeat the saving throw when
              it is at least 1 mile away from the aboleth.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in an 60-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (13d6) fire damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 60-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution
              saving throw or fall unconscious for 10 minutes. This effect ends
              for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an
              action to wake it.

              **Lightning Breath.** The dragon exhales lightning in a 90-foot
              line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a
              DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking 66 (12d10) lightning damage
              on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Repulsion Breath.** The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a
              30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 19
              Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 60
              feet away from the dragon.

              a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
              form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
              wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
              dragon's choice).

              In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit
              Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
              actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as
              this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise
              replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or
              legendary actions of that form.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 60-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 18
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its
              speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in a 60-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must make a DC 21 Dexterity saving throw,
              taking 66 (12d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
              damage on a successful one.

              **Weakening Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 60-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 21 Strength saving
              throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls,
              Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A
              creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
              turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

              The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has
              a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
              form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
              wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
              dragon's choice).

              In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit
              Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
              actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as
              this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise
              replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or
              legendary actions of that form.

              **Cold Breath.** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot
              cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution
              saving throw, taking 58 (13d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
              half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a
              60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20
              Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature
              can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
              ending the effect on itself on a success.

              The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has
              a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
              form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
              wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
              dragon's choice).

              In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit
              Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
              actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as
              this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise
              replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or
              legendary actions of that form.

              Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 13 Strength
              saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 15 (3d8 + 2)
              bludgeoning damage and is flung up 20 feet away from the elemental
              in a random direction and knocked prone. If a thrown target
              strikes an object, such as a wall or floor, the target takes 3
              (1d6) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown. If the
              target is thrown at another creature, that creature must succeed
              on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take the same damage and be
              knocked prone.

              If the saving throw is successful, the target takes half the
              bludgeoning damage and isn't flung away or knocked prone.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 90-foot line that
              is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 90-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its
              speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

              a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
              form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
              wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
              dragon's choice).

              In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit
              Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
              actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as
              this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise
              replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or
              legendary actions of that form.

              **Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in a 90-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must make a DC 24 Dexterity saving throw,
              taking 71 (13d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
              damage on a successful one.

              **Weakening Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 90-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Strength saving
              throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls,
              Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A
              creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
              turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

              a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
              form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is
              wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the
              dragon's choice).

              In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit
              Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair
              actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as
              this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise
              replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or
              legendary actions of that form.

              half as much damage on a successful one.

               **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a 90- foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 24 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

              a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true
              form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is

              The sphinx emits a magical roar. Each time it roars before
              finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is
              different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the
              sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.

              **First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving
              throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat
              the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
              effect on itself on a success.

              **Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving
              throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened
              creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end
              of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

              **Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage
              and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes
              half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

              The sphinx is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability
              is Wisdom (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). It
              requires no material components to cast its spells. The sphinx has
              the following cleric spells prepared:

              If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the basilisk and
              the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the
              creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk
              isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically
              begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the
              saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect
              ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the
              greater restoration spell or other magic.

              A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the
              saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see
              the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert
              its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it
              must immediately make the save.

              If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 ft. of it in bright
              light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its
              gaze.

              and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and

              swallowed at a time.

              swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
              saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature,
              which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the behir. If the
              behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and
              can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting
              prone.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in an 20-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 15-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
              saving throw or fall unconscious for 1 minute. This effect ends
              for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an
              action to wake it.

              On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns while
              berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no
              creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem attacks
              an object, with preference for an object smaller than itself. Once
              the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until it is
              destroyed or regains all its hit points.

              The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself
              if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic
              its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to
              track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an
              area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

              Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a
              harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls
              randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the
              duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it
              can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

              A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an
              attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw
              against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

            desc: >-
              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 20-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 1 5-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
              saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions,
              its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

              The couatl magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has
              a challenge rating equal to or less than its own, or back into its
              true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment
              it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form
              (the couatl's choice).

              In a new form, the couatl retains its game statistics and ability
              to speak, but its AC, movement modes, Strength, Dexterity, and
              other actions are replaced by those of the new form, and it gains
              any statistics and capabilities (except class features, legendary
              actions, and lair actions) that the new form has but that it
              lacks. If the new form has a bite attack, the couatl can use its
              bite in that form.

              The couatl's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14).
              It can innately cast the following spells, requiring only verbal
              components:


              At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect thoughts

              3/day each: bless, create food and water, cure wounds, lesser
              restoration, protection from poison, sanctuary, shield

              1/day each: dream, greater restoration, scrying
          - name: Magic Weapons
            desc: The couatl's weapon attacks are magical.
          - name: Shielded Mind
            desc: The couatl is immune to scrying and to any effect that would sense its
              emotions, read its thoughts, or detect its location.

              Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 6
              (1d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the darkmantle attaches to the
              target. If the target is Medium or smaller and the darkmantle has
              advantage on the attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the
              target's head, and the target is also blinded and unable to
              breathe while the darkmantle is attached in this way.

              While attached to the target, the darkmantle can attack no other
              creature except the target but has advantage on its attack rolls.
              The darkmantle's speed also becomes 0, it can't benefit from any
              bonus to its speed, and it moves with the target.

              A creature can detach the darkmantle by making a successful DC 13
              Strength check as an action. On its turn, the darkmantle can
              detach itself from the target by using 5 feet of movement.

              moves with it, and spreads around corners. The darkness lasts as
              long as the darkmantle maintains concentration, up to 10 minutes
              (as if concentrating on a spell). Darkvision can't penetrate this
              darkness, and no natural light can illuminate it. If any of the
              darkness overlaps with an area of light created by a spell of 2nd
              level or lower, the spell creating the light is dispelled.

              A 5-foot-radius, 30-foot-tall cylinder of swirling air magically
              forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The
              whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as
              if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that
              enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw
              or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60
              feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move
              with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

              A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
              whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength
              check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained
              and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

            desc: >-
              The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save
              DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave

              3/day each: create food and water (can create wine instead of
              water), tongues, wind walk

              1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation,
              gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift
          - name: "Variant: Genie Powers"
            desc: >-
              Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A
              few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their
              appearance or the nature of reality.


              **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass
              as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast
              the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than
              is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true
              polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer
              duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,
              but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as
              well.

              **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among
              mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the
              nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can
              grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a
              genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again
              for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates
              that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific
              creature only once in that creature's existence.

              To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie
              states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish
              spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.
              Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert
              the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The
              perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's
              benefit.

              The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30
              feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a
              DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed
              creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and
              protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it
              takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it
              can.

              Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the
              target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
              itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until
              the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the
              target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving
              throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm
              for the next 24 hours.

              The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three
              beasts charmed at a time.

              second living tree within 60 ft. of the first tree, appearing in
              an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the second tree. Both trees
              must be large or bigger.

              The efreeti's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save
              DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect magic

              3/day each: enlarge/reduce, tongues

              1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form,
              invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire
          - name: "Variant: Genie Powers"
            desc: >-
              Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A
              few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their
              appearance or the nature of reality.


              **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass
              as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast
              the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than
              is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true
              polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer
              duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,
              but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as
              well.

              **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among
              mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the
              nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can
              grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a
              genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again
              for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates
              that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific
              creature only once in that creature's existence.

              To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie
              states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish
              spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.
              Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert
              the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The
              perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's
              benefit.

          - name: Berserk
            desc: >-
              Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer,
              roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns
              while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see.
              If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem
              attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than
              itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until
              it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

              The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can
              try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must
              be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC
              15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem
              ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit
              points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.
          - name: Immutable Form
            desc: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.
          - name: Lightning Absorption
            desc: Whenever the golem is subjected to lightning damage, it takes no damage
              and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning
              damage dealt.
          - name: Magic Resistance
            desc: The golem has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
              effects.
          - name: Magic Weapons

              The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large
              or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a
              creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
              throw.

              On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet
              back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be
              pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

              On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the
              creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed
              creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid
              damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube
              moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

              An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make
              a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and
              enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

              The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the
              space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's
              Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.

              Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.

              A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a
              creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful
              DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10
              (3d6) acid damage.

              The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or
              smaller creatures inside it at a time.

              unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

              otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain
              access to the target's knowledge, class features, or
              proficiencies.

              The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the
              ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced
              out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the
              possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within
              5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession
              for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the
              possession ends.

            desc: >-
              The toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target
              it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and
              the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded and restrained,
              it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
              toad, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of
              the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a
              time.

              If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by
              it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement,
              exiting prone.

              action and uses all its movement to move in a randomly determined
              direction. On a 7 or 8, the creature makes a melee attack against
              a randomly determined creature within its reach or does nothing if
              it can't make such an attack.

              creature in that area must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,
              taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much
              damage on a successful one.

              **Weakening Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 15-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving
              throw or have disadvantage on Strength-based attack rolls,
              Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A
              creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
              turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

              The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
              with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature
              of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the
              hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

              The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
              inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin,
              but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a
              creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
              succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
              that the hag is disguised.

              so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or
              carries is invisible with her.

          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.
          - name: Innate Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
              12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
              material components:


              At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery
          - name: Mimicry
            desc: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears
              the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14
              Wisdom (Insight) check.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.

              The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within
              300 ft. of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC
              11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The
              harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue
              singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the
              harpy is incapacitated.

              While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores
              the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5
              ft. away from the harpy, the must move on its turn toward the
              harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity
              attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or
              a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the
              harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also
              repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a
              creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

              A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song
              for the next 24 hours.

              The hydra has five heads. While it has more than one head, the
              hydra has advantage on saving throws against being blinded,
              charmed, deafened, frightened, stunned, and knocked unconscious.

              Whenever the hydra takes 25 or more damage in a single turn, one
              of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.

              At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads
              that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage
              since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head
              regrown in this way.
          - name: Reactive Heads
            desc: For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can
              be used only for opportunity attacks.
          - name: Wakeful
            desc: While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.

          - name: Wall of Ice
            desc: >-
              The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface
              it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up
              to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up
              to 20 feet in diameter.

              When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of
              it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the
              wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The
              creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35
              (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
              successful one.

              The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or
              dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section
              has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and
              immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a
              section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in
              the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving
              through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the
              creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17
              (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
              successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the
              wall vanishes.

        traits:
          - name: Devil's Sight
            desc: Magical darkness doesn't impede the imp's darkvision.
          - name: Magic Resistance
            desc: The imp has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
              effects.
          - name: Shapechanger
            desc: The imp can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a
              rat (speed 20 ft.), a raven (20 ft., fly 60 ft.), or a spider (20
              ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its statistics are
              the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any
              equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts
              to its true form if it dies.
          - name: "Variant: Familiar"
            desc: The imp can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic
              bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master
              can sense what the imp senses as long as they are within 1 mile of
              each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the
              master shares the imp's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and
              for any reason, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending
              the telepathic bond.

          - name: Petrifying Gaze
            desc: >-
              When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn
              within 30 ft. of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC
              14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and
              can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the
              creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails
              the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained
              creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn,
              becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.
              The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater
              restoration spell or other magic.

              Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the
              saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it
              can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can
              avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the
              meantime, it must immediately make the save.

              If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within
              30 ft. of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to
              its curse, affected by its own gaze.

              on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast
              on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As
              long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If
              these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no
              benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5
              (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to
              0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is
              trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit
              point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell
              or similar magic.

        traits:
          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.
          - name: Innate Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
              14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect magic, magic missile

              2/day each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep
          - name: Magic Resistance
            desc: The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
              effects.
          - name: Night Hag Items
            desc: >-
              A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft
              for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to
              great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time
              and effort.

              Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become
              ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone
              also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

              Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's
              Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack
              made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at
              a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a
              soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid
              sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.

              as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the
              pseudodragon is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion
              shares the pseudodragon's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and
              for any reason, the pseudodragon can end its service as a
              familiar, ending the telepathic bond.

              Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22
              (3d8 + 9) piercing damage. If the target is a Large or smaller
              creature, it must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or be
              swallowed by the worm. A swallowed creature is blinded and
              restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects
              outside the worm, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start
              of each of the worm's turns.

              If the worm takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from a
              creature inside it, the worm must succeed on a DC 21 Constitution
              saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
              creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet of the worm.
              If the worm dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by
              it and can escape from the corpse by using 20 feet of movement,
              exiting prone.

              Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
              all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10
              feet oft he remorhaz. If the remorhaz dies, a swallowed creature
              is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse using
              15 feet of movement, exiting prone.

              The rust monster corrodes a nonmagical ferrous metal object it can
              see within 5 feet of it. If the object isn't being worn or
              carried, the touch destroys a 1-foot cube of it. If the object is
              being worn or carried by a creature, the creature can make a DC 11
              Dexterity saving throw to avoid the rust monster's touch.

              If the object touched is either metal armor or a metal shield
              being worn or carried, its takes a permanent and cumulative -1
              penalty to the AC it offers. Armor reduced to an AC of 10 or a
              shield that drops to a +0 bonus is destroyed. If the object
              touched is a held metal weapon, it rusts as described in the Rust
              Metal trait.

            desc: >-
              The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
              with a magical illusion that makes her look like an ugly creature
              of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag
              takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

              The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
              inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws,
              but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a
              creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
              succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
              that the hag is disguised.

            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.
          - name: Horrific Appearance
            desc: >-
              Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and
              can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.
              On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A
              creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
              turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight,
              ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
              throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
              immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

              Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true
              form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the
              initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature
              that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the
              hag.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.

              guardian and its amulet are on the same plane of existence, the
              amulet's wearer can telepathically call the guardian to travel to
              it, and the guardian knows the distance and direction to the
              amulet. If the guardian is within 60 feet of the amulet's wearer,

            desc: A spellcaster who wears the shield guardian's amulet can cause the
              guardian to store one spell of 4th level or lower. To do so, the
              wearer must cast the spell on the guardian. The spell has no
              effect but is stored within the guardian. When commanded to do so
              by the wearer or when a situation arises that was predefined by
              the spellcaster, the guardian casts the stored spell with any
              parameters set by the original caster, requiring no components.
              When the spell is cast or a new spell is stored, any previously
              stored spell is lost.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Cold Breath.** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 15-foot
              cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 13 Constitution
              saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
              half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a
              15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 13
              Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature
              can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
              ending the effect on itself on a success.

            desc: The solar releases its greatsword to hover magically in an unoccupied
              space within 5 ft. of it. If the solar can see the sword, the
              solar can mentally command it as a bonus action to fly up to 50
              ft. and either make one attack against a target or return to the
              solar's hands. If the hovering sword is targeted by any effect,
              the solar is considered to be holding it. The hovering sword falls
              if the solar dies.

              While attached, the stirge doesn't attack. Instead, at the start
              of each of the stirge's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit
              points due to blood loss.

              The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.
              It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target
              or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its
              action to detach the stirge.

              One humanoid the fiend can see within 30 feet of it must succeed
              on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed for 1 day.
              The charmed target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic
              commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal
              command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a
              success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or
              if the effect on it ends, the target is immune to this fiend's
              Charm for the next 24 hours.

              The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms
              another, the effect on the previous target ends.

              maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This
              reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target
              dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

              isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.

              bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends.

              total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
              tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each
              of the tarrasque's turns.

              If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a
              creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20
              Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
              all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10
              feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature
              is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by
              using 30 feet of movement, exiting prone.

              magical effects.

            desc: Any time the tarrasque is targeted by a magic missile spell, a line spell,
              or a spell that requires a ranged attack roll, roll a d6. On a 1
              to 5, the tarrasque is unaffected. On a 6, the tarrasque is
              unaffected, and the effect is reflected back at the caster as
              though it originated from the tarrasque, turning the caster into
              the target.
          - name: Siege Monster
            desc: The tarrasque deals double damage to objects and structures.

              its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

            desc: >-
              Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time,
              roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:


              **1-10:** Nothing else happens.

              **11-14:** One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs
              left.

              **15- 18:** One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms
              left.

              **19-20:** The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it
              can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.


              If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a
              severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed
              part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's
              initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has
              AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.

              A **severed leg** is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.

              A **severed arm** has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw
              attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless
              the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll
              loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.

              If its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its
              body is blinded unless the head can see it. The **severed head**
              has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can
              make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.

              The troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses
              both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With
              only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no
              arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to
              speed.

              If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC
              17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the
              vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted
              friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under
              the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions
              in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for
              the vampire's bite attack.

              Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything
              harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the
              effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24

              When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the

              vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours

              point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit

          - name: Regeneration
            desc: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at
              least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the
              vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait
              doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.
          - name: Shapechanger
            desc: >-
              If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its
              action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or
              back into its true form.

              While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5
              feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other
              than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing
              transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to
              its true form if it dies.

              While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or
              manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20
              feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop
              there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can
              do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has
              advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws,
              and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it
              takes from sunlight.
          - name: Spider Climb
            desc: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on
              ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
          - name: Vampire Weaknesses
            desc: >-
              The vampire has the following flaws:

              Forbiddance. The vampire can't enter a residence without an
              invitation from one of the occupants.

              Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it
              ends its turn in running water.

              Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven
              into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its
              resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is
              removed.

              Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage
              when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has
              disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

              its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon
              other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner
              dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

              Each creature in the elemental's space must make a DC 15 Strength
              saving throw. On a failure, a target takes 13 (2d8 + 4)
              bludgeoning damage. If it is Large or smaller, it is also grappled
              (escape DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained
              and unable to breathe unless it can breathe water. If the saving
              throw is successful, the target is pushed out of the elemental's
              space.

              The elemental can grapple one Large creature or up to two Medium
              or smaller creatures at one time. At the start of each of the
              elemental's turns, each target grappled by it takes 13 (2d8 + 4)
              bludgeoning damage. A creature within 5 feet of the elemental can
              pull a creature or object out of it by taking an action to make a
              DC 14 Strength and succeeding.

              **Fire Breath.** The dragon exhales fire in a 40-foot line that is
              5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
              saving throw or fall unconscious for 5 minutes. This effect ends
              for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an
              action to wake it.

              **Lightning Breath.** The dragon exhales lightning in a 60-foot
              line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a
              DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 55 (10d10) lightning damage
              on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Repulsion Breath.** The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a
              30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15
              Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 40
              feet away from the dragon.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 40-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (9d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 30-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its
              speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Cold Breath.** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot
              cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution
              saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
              half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a
              30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17
              Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature
              can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
              ending the effect on itself on a success.

              The sphinx emits a magical roar. Each time it roars before
              finishing a long rest, the roar is louder and the effect is
              different, as detailed below. Each creature within 500 feet of the
              sphinx and able to hear the roar must make a saving throw.

              **First Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving
              throw is frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat
              the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
              effect on itself on a success.

              **Second Roar.** Each creature that fails a DC 18 Wisdom saving
              throw is deafened and frightened for 1 minute. A frightened
              creature is paralyzed and can repeat the saving throw at the end
              of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

              **Third Roar.** Each creature makes a DC 18 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) thunder damage
              and is knocked prone. On a successful save, the creature takes
              half as much damage and isn't knocked prone.

          **Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters
          dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel
          kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom.
          Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote
          towers to practice their magic without interruption.

          An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an
          archmage's abode has numerous magical wards and guardians to
          discourage interlopers.

          It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue
          to keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these
          qualities in spades. 

          In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate
          captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect
          and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out
          rewards and punishment on a regular basis. 

          More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy.
          A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely
          to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to
          know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.

              If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the basilisk and
              the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the
              creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk
              isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically
              begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the
              saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect
              ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the
              greater restoration spell or other magic.

              A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the
              saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see
              the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert
              its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it
              must immediately make the save.

              If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 ft. of it in bright
              light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its
              gaze.

              which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the behir. If the
              behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and
              can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Lightning Breath.** The dragon exhales lightning in a 40-foot
              line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a
              DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 16 (3d10) lightning damage on
              a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Repulsion Breath.** The dragon exhales repulsion energy in a
              30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 12
              Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is pushed 30
              feet away from the dragon.

              throw or become frightened until the end of the cloaker's next
              turn. If a creature's saving throw is successful, the creature is
              immune to the cloaker's moan for the next 24 hours.

            desc: >-
              The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself
              if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic
              its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to
              track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an
              area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

              Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a
              harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls
              randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the
              duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it
              can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

              A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an
              attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw
              against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 20-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 1 5-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
              saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions,
              its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

              forms on a point the djinni can see within 120 feet of it. The
              whirlwind lasts as long as the djinni maintains concentration (as
              if concentrating on a spell). Any creature but the djinni that
              enters the whirlwind must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw
              or be restrained by it. The djinni can move the whirlwind up to 60
              feet as an action, and creatures restrained by the whirlwind move
              with it. The whirlwind ends if the djinni loses sight of it.

              A creature can use its action to free a creature restrained by the
              whirlwind, including itself, by succeeding on a DC 18 Strength
              check. If the check succeeds, the creature is no longer restrained
              and moves to the nearest space outside the whirlwind.

              The djinni's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save
              DC 17, +9 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect evil and good, detect magic, thunderwave

              3/day each: create food and water (can create wine instead of
              water), tongues, wind walk

              1/day each: conjure elemental (air elemental only), creation,
              gaseous form, invisibility, major image, plane shift
          - name: "Variant: Genie Powers"
            desc: >-
              Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A
              few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their
              appearance or the nature of reality.


              **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass
              as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast
              the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than
              is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true
              polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer
              duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,
              but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as
              well.

              **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among
              mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the
              nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can
              grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a
              genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again
              for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates
              that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific
              creature only once in that creature's existence.

              To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie
              states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish
              spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.
              Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert
              the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The
              perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's
              benefit.

              The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30
              feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a
              DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed
              creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and
              protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it
              takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it
              can.

              Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the
              target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
              itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until
              the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the
              target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving
              throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm
              for the next 24 hours.

              The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three
              beasts charmed at a time.

              14). The dryad can innately cast the following spells, requiring
              no material components:


              At will: druidcraft

              magically into one living tree within her reach and emerge from a
              second living tree within 60 ft. of the first tree, appearing in
              an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the second tree. Both trees
              must be large or bigger.

              The efreeti's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save
              DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect magic

              3/day each: enlarge/reduce, tongues

              1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form,
              invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire
          - name: "Variant: Genie Powers"
            desc: >-
              Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A
              few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their
              appearance or the nature of reality.


              **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass
              as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast
              the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than
              is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true
              polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer
              duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,
              but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as
              well.

              **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among
              mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the
              nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can
              grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a
              genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again
              for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates
              that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific
              creature only once in that creature's existence.

              To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie
              states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish
              spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.
              Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert
              the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The
              perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's
              benefit.

              The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large
              or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a
              creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
              throw.

              On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet
              back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be
              pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

              On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the
              creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed
              creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid
              damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube
              moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

              An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make
              a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and
              enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

              space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's
              Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.

              Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.

              A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a
              creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful
              DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10
              (3d6) acid damage.

              The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or
              smaller creatures inside it at a time.

              unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

              succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1
              minute. If the save fails by 5 or more, the target also ages 1d4 x
              10 years. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the
              end of each of its turns, ending the frightened condition on
              itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or
              the effect ends for it, the target is immune to this ghost's
              Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. The aging effect can be
              reversed with a greater restoration spell, but only within 24
              hours of it occurring.

            desc: >-
              One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must
              succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the
              ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated
              and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but
              doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be
              targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that
              turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom,
              Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It
              otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain
              access to the target's knowledge, class features, or
              proficiencies.

              The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the
              ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced
              out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the
              possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within
              5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession
              for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the
              possession ends.

            desc: >-
              Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes.
              After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative
              -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon
              is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the
              ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.

              The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1
              round.
          - name: False Appearance
            desc: While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an oily
              pool or wet rock.

            desc: >-
              The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
              with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature
              of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the
              hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

              The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
              inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin,
              but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a
              creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
              succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
              that the hag is disguised.
          - name: Invisible Passage
            desc: The hag magically turns invisible until she attacks or casts a spell, or
              until her concentration ends (as if concentrating on a spell).
              While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage,
              so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or
              carries is invisible with her.

          - name: Innate Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
              12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
              material components:


              At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery
          - name: Mimicry
            desc: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears
              the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14
              Wisdom (Insight) check.
          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

              The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within
              300 ft. of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC
              11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The
              harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue
              singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the
              harpy is incapacitated.

              While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores
              the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5
              ft. away from the harpy, the must move on its turn toward the
              harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity
              attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or
              a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the
              harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also
              repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a
              creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

              A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song
              for the next 24 hours.

              of its heads dies. If all its heads die, the hydra dies.

              At the end of its turn, it grows two heads for each of its heads
              that died since its last turn, unless it has taken fire damage
              since its last turn. The hydra regains 10 hit points for each head
              regrown in this way.
          - name: Reactive Heads
            desc: For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra reaction that can
              be used only for opportunity attacks.
          - name: Wakeful
            desc: While the hydra sleeps, at least one of its heads is awake.

          - name: Wall of Ice
            desc: >-
              The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface
              it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up
              to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up
              to 20 feet in diameter.

              When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of
              it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the
              wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The
              creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35
              (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
              successful one.

              The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or
              dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section
              has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and
              immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a
              section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in
              the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving
              through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the
              creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17
              (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
              successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the
              wall vanishes.

              When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn
              within 30 ft. of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC
              14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and
              can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the
              creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails
              the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained
              creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn,
              becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.
              The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater
              restoration spell or other magic.

              Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the
              saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it
              can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can
              avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the
              meantime, it must immediately make the save.

              If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within
              30 ft. of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to
              its curse, affected by its own gaze.

              creature within 15 feet of the nalfeshnee that can see the light
              must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1
              minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
              of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
              creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it,
              the creature is immune to the nalfeshnee's Horror Nimbus for the
              next 24 hours.

          - name: "Variant: Summon Demon (1/Day)"
            desc: >-
              The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

              A nalfeshnee has a 50 percent chance of summoning 1d4 vrocks, 1d3
              hezrous, 1d2 glabrezus, or one nalfeshnee.

              A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of
              its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon
              other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner
              dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.

              Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She

            desc: The hag magically enters the Ethereal Plane from the Material Plane, or

              possession.
          - name: Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)
            desc: While on the Ethereal Plane, the hag magically touches a sleeping humanoid
              on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast
              on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As
              long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If
              these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no
              benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5
              (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to
              0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is
              trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit
              point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell
              or similar magic.

            desc: >-
              The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
              14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect magic, magic missile

              2/day each: plane shift (self only), ray of enfeeblement, sleep
          - name: Magic Resistance
            desc: The hag has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
              effects.
          - name: Night Hag Items
            desc: >-
              A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft
              for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to
              great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time
              and effort.

              Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become
              ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone
              also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

              Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's
              Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack
              made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at
              a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a
              soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid
              sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).
          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

          **Priests** bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They
          are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold
          positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work
          openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects
          hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. 

          A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious
          ceremonies and other sacred duties.

              climb 40 ft.), or a toad (40 ft., swim 40 ft.), or back into its
              true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for
              the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying
              isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
          - name: Magic Resistance
            desc: The quasit has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical
              effects.
          - name: "Variant: Familiar"
            desc: The quasit can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a telepathic
              bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master
              can sense what the quasit senses as long as they are within 1 mile
              of each other. While the quasit is within 10 feet of its master,
              the master shares the quasit's Magic Resistance trait. At any time
              and for any reason, the quasit can end its service as a familiar,
              ending the telepathic bond.

            desc: >-
              The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying

              of her general size and humanoid shape. The effect ends if the hag
              takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

              The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
              inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws,
              but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a
              creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
              succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
              that the hag is disguised.

              Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and
              can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.
              On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A
              creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
              turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight,
              ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
              throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
              immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

              Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true
              form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the
              initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature
              that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the
              hag.
          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

              The charmed target obeys the fiend's verbal or telepathic
              commands. If the target suffers any harm or receives a suicidal
              command, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a
              success. If the target successfully saves against the effect, or

              Charm for the next 24 hours.

              The fiend can have only one target charmed at a time. If it charms

              half as much damage on a successful one. The target's hit point
              maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This

              bite's damage, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends.
              While swallowed, the creature is blinded and restrained, it has
              total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
              tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each
              of the tarrasque's turns.

              If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a
              creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20
              Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate
              all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10
              feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature
              is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by

              its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

            desc: >-
              Whenever the troll takes at least 15 slashing damage at one time,
              roll a d20 to determine what else happens to it:


              **1-10:** Nothing else happens.

              **11-14:** One leg is severed from the troll if it has any legs
              left.

              **15- 18:** One arm is severed from the troll if it has any arms
              left.

              **19-20:** The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it
              can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.


              If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a
              severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed
              part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's
              initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has
              AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.

              A **severed leg** is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.

              A **severed arm** has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw
              attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless
              the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll
              loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.

              If its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its
              body is blinded unless the head can see it. The **severed head**
              has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can
              make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.

              The troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses
              both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With
              only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no
              arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to
              speed.

              The vampire targets one humanoid it can see within 30 ft. of it.
              If the target can see the vampire, the target must succeed on a DC
              17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the
              vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted
              friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under
              the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions
              in the most favorable way it can, and it is a willing target for
              the vampire's bite attack.

              Each time the vampire or the vampire's companions do anything
              harmful to the target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the
              effect on itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24

              of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the
              effect.

              sun isn't up. While outdoors, the vampire can call 3d6 wolves
              instead. The called creatures arrive in 1d4 rounds, acting as
              allies of the vampire and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts
              remain for 1 hour, until the vampire dies, or until the vampire
              dismisses them as a bonus action.

          spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
        legendary_actions:

          - name: Unarmed Strike

          - name: Bite (Costs 2 Actions)

        special_abilities:
          - name: Shapechanger
            desc: >-
              If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its
              action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or
              back into its true form.

              While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5
              feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other
              than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing
              transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to
              its true form if it dies.

              While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or
              manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20
              feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop
              there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can
              do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has
              advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws,
              and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it
              takes from sunlight.
          - name: Legendary Resistance (3/Day)
            desc: If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
          - name: Misty Escape
            desc: >-
              When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the
              vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger
              trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in
              sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.

              While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its
              vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours
              or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its
              vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit
              point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit
              points, it regains 1 hit point.
          - name: Regeneration
            desc: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at
              least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the
              vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait
              doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.
          - name: Spider Climb
            desc: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on
              ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
          - name: Vampire Weaknesses
            desc: >-
              The vampire has the following flaws:

              Forbiddance. The vampire can't enter a residence without an
              invitation from one of the occupants.

              Harmed by Running Water. The vampire takes 20 acid damage if it
              ends its turn in running water.

              Stake to the Heart. If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven
              into the vampire's heart while the vampire is incapacitated in its
              resting place, the vampire is paralyzed until the stake is
              removed.

              Sunlight Hypersensitivity. The vampire takes 20 radiant damage
              when it starts its turn in sunlight. While in sunlight, it has
              disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 40-foot line that

              Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (9d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 30-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its
              speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

              damage on a successful one.

              **Weakening Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 30-foot cone.

              Strength checks, and Strength saving throws for 1 minute. A
