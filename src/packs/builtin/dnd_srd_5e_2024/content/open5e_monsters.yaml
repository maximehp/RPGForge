              condition and moves with the whirlwind. At the start of each of
              its turns, the Restrained target takes 21 (6d6) Thunder damage. At

              non-genie creature who communicates a wish in a way the djinni can
              understand. If the djinni casts the spell for the creature, the
              djinni suffers none of the spell's stress. Once the djinni has
              cast it three times, the djinni can't do so again for 365 days.

              the efreeti suffers none of the spell's stress. Once the efreeti
              has cast it three times, the efreeti can't do so again for 365
              days.

              a DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check; the golem must be able to
              hear its creator. If this check succeeds, the golem ceases being
              berserk until the start of its next turn, at which point it
              resumes rolling for the Berserk trait again if it is still

            desc: The frog swallows a Small or smaller target it is grappling. While
              swallowed, the target isn't Grappled but has the Blinded and
              Restrained conditions, and it has Cover|XPHB|Total Cover against
              attacks and other effects outside the frog. While swallowing the
              target, the frog can't use Bite, and if the frog dies, the
              swallowed target is no longer Restrained and can escape from the
              corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the Prone condition.
              At the end of the frog's next turn, the swallowed target takes 5
              (2d4) Acid damage. If that damage doesn't kill it, the frog
              disgorges it, causing it to exit Prone.

            desc: The toad swallows a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. While
              swallowed, the target isn't Grappled but has the Blinded and
              Restrained conditions, and it has Cover|XPHB|Total Cover against
              attacks and other effects outside the toad. In addition, the
              target takes 10 (3d6) Acid damage at the end of each of the toad's
              turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time, and
              it can't use Bite while it has a swallowed target. If the toad
              dies, a swallowed creature is no longer Restrained and can escape
              from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting with the Prone
              condition.

              single turn, one of its heads dies. The hydra dies if all its
              heads are dead. At the end of each of its turns when it has at
              least one living head, the hydra grows two heads for each of its
              heads that died since its last turn, unless it has taken Fire
              damage since its last turn. The hydra regains 20 Hit Points when
              it grows new heads.
          - name: Reactive Heads
            desc: For each head the hydra has beyond one, it gets an extra Reaction that can
              be used only for Opportunity Attacks.

              previously stored spell is lost when a new spell is stored. The
              guardian can cast the spell stored with any parameters set by the
              original caster, requiring no spell components and using the
              caster's spellcasting ability. The stored spell is then lost.

              higher. When the creature is outside a body of water, it takes 6
              (1d12) acid damage every 10 minutes unless moisture is applied to
              the skin before 10 minutes have passed."

              **Cold Breath.** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 60-foot
              cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 20 Constitution
              saving throw, taking 58 (13d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
              half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a
              60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 20
              Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature
              can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 90-foot line that
              is 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 22
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 63 (14d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 90-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its
              speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

          **Archmages** are powerful (and usually quite old) spellcasters
          dedicated to the study of the arcane arts. Benevolent ones counsel
          kings and queens, while evil ones rule as tyrants and pursue lichdom.
          Those who are neither good nor evil sequester themselves in remote
          towers to practice their magic without interruption.

          An archmage typically has one or more apprentice mages, and an

          **Bandits** rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or
          spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease,
          or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of
          banditry. 

          **Pirates** are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters
          interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers
          sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's
          vessels.

          It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue
          to keep a gang of bandits in line. The **bandit captain** has these
          qualities in spades. 

          In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the **pirate
          captain** is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect
          and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out
          rewards and punishment on a regular basis. 

          More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy.
          A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely
          to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to
          know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.

              If a creature starts its turn within 30 ft. of the basilisk and
              the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can force the
              creature to make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw if the basilisk
              isn't incapacitated. On a failed save, the creature magically
              begins to turn to stone and is restrained. It must repeat the
              saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect
              ends. On a failure, the creature is petrified until freed by the
              greater restoration spell or other magic.

              A creature that isn't surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the
              saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can't see
              the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert
              its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it
              must immediately make the save.

              If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 ft. of it in bright
              light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its
              gaze.

              The cloaker magically creates three illusory duplicates of itself
              if it isn't in bright light. The duplicates move with it and mimic
              its actions, shifting position so as to make it impossible to
              track which cloaker is the real one. If the cloaker is ever in an
              area of bright light, the duplicates disappear.

              Whenever any creature targets the cloaker with an attack or a
              harmful spell while a duplicate remains, that creature rolls
              randomly to determine whether it targets the cloaker or one of the
              duplicates. A creature is unaffected by this magical effect if it
              can't see or if it relies on senses other than sight.

              A duplicate has the cloaker's AC and uses its saving throws. If an
              attack hits a duplicate, or if a duplicate fails a saving throw
              against an effect that deals damage, the duplicate disappears.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 20-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 11
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 1 5-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
              saving throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions,
              its speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

            desc: >-
              Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A
              few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their
              appearance or the nature of reality.


              **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass
              as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast
              the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than
              is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true
              polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer
              duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,
              but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as
              well.

              **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among
              mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the
              nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can
              grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a
              genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again
              for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates
              that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific
              creature only once in that creature's existence.

              To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie
              states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish
              spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.
              Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert
              the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The
              perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's
              benefit.

              The dryad targets one humanoid or beast that she can see within 30
              feet of her. If the target can see the dryad, it must succeed on a
              DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be magically charmed. The charmed
              creature regards the dryad as a trusted friend to be heeded and
              protected. Although the target isn't under the dryad's control, it
              takes the dryad's requests or actions in the most favorable way it
              can.

              Each time the dryad or its allies do anything harmful to the
              target, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on
              itself on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until
              the dryad dies, is on a different plane of existence from the
              target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a target's saving
              throw is successful, the target is immune to the dryad's Fey Charm
              for the next 24 hours.

              The dryad can have no more than one humanoid and up to three
              beasts charmed at a time.

              The efreeti's innate spell casting ability is Charisma (spell save
              DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect magic

              3/day each: enlarge/reduce, tongues

              1/day each: conjure elemental (fire elemental only), gaseous form,
              invisibility, major image, plane shift, wall of fire
          - name: "Variant: Genie Powers"
            desc: >-
              Genies have a variety of magical capabilities, including spells. A
              few have even greater powers that allow them to alter their
              appearance or the nature of reality.


              **Disguises.** Some genies can veil themselves in illusion to pass
              as other similarly shaped creatures. Such genies can innately cast
              the disguise self spell at will, often with a longer duration than
              is normal for that spell. Mightier genies can cast the true
              polymorph spell one to three times per day, possibly with a longer
              duration than normal. Such genies can change only their own shape,
              but a rare few can use the spell on other creatures and objects as
              well.

              **Wishes.** The genie power to grant wishes is legendary among
              mortals. Only the most potent genies, such as those among the
              nobility, can do so. A particular genie that has this power can
              grant one to three wishes to a creature that isn't a genie. Once a
              genie has granted its limit of wishes, it can't grant wishes again
              for some amount of time (usually 1 year). and cosmic law dictates
              that the same genie can expend its limit of wishes on a specific
              creature only once in that creature's existence.

              To be granted a wish, a creature within 60 feet of the genie
              states a desired effect to it. The genie can then cast the wish
              spell on the creature's behalf to bring about the effect.
              Depending on the genie's nature, the genie might try to pervert
              the intent of the wish by exploiting the wish's poor wording. The
              perversion of the wording is usually crafted to be to the genie's
              benefit.

              Whenever the golem starts its turn with 40 hit points or fewer,
              roll a d6. On a 6, the golem goes berserk. On each of its turns
              while berserk, the golem attacks the nearest creature it can see.
              If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, the golem
              attacks an object, with preference for an object smaller than
              itself. Once the golem goes berserk, it continues to do so until
              it is destroyed or regains all its hit points.

              The golem's creator, if within 60 feet of the berserk golem, can
              try to calm it by speaking firmly and persuasively. The golem must
              be able to hear its creator, who must take an action to make a DC
              15 Charisma (Persuasion) check. If the check succeeds, the golem
              ceases being berserk. If it takes damage while still at 40 hit
              points or fewer, the golem might go berserk again.
          - name: Aversion of Fire

            desc: The golem is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

              and instead regains a number of hit points equal to the lightning
              damage dealt.
          - name: Magic Resistance

              The cube moves up to its speed. While doing so, it can enter Large
              or smaller creatures' spaces. Whenever the cube enters a
              creature's space, the creature must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving
              throw.

              On a successful save, the creature can choose to be pushed 5 feet
              back or to the side of the cube. A creature that chooses not to be
              pushed suffers the consequences of a failed saving throw.

              On a failed save, the cube enters the creature's space, and the
              creature takes 10 (3d6) acid damage and is engulfed. The engulfed
              creature can't breathe, is restrained, and takes 21 (6d6) acid
              damage at the start of each of the cube's turns. When the cube
              moves, the engulfed creature moves with it.

              An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an action to make
              a DC 12 Strength check. On a success, the creature escapes and
              enters a space of its choice within 5 feet of the cube.

              The cube takes up its entire space. Other creatures can enter the
              space, but a creature that does so is subjected to the cube's
              Engulf and has disadvantage on the saving throw.

              Creatures inside the cube can be seen but have total cover.

              A creature within 5 feet of the cube can take an action to pull a
              creature or object out of the cube. Doing so requires a successful
              DC 12 Strength check, and the creature making the attempt takes 10
              (3d6) acid damage.

              The cube can hold only one Large creature or up to four Medium or
              smaller creatures inside it at a time.

              attacked. A creature that tries to enter the cube's space while
              unaware of the cube is surprised by the cube.

              One humanoid that the ghost can see within 5 ft. of it must
              succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw or be possessed by the
              ghost; the ghost then disappears, and the target is incapacitated
              and loses control of its body. The ghost now controls the body but
              doesn't deprive the target of awareness. The ghost can't be
              targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that
              turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom,
              Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It
              otherwise uses the possessed target's statistics, but doesn't gain
              access to the target's knowledge, class features, or
              proficiencies.

              The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the
              ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced
              out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the
              possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within
              5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost's Possession
              for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the
              possession ends.

              it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
              toad, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid damage at the start of each of
              the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a
              time.

              it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement,
              exiting prone.

              The hag covers herself and anything she is wearing or carrying
              with a magical illusion that makes her look like another creature
              of her general size and humanoid shape. The illusion ends if the
              hag takes a bonus action to end it or if she dies.

              The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
              inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have smooth skin,
              but someone touching her would feel her rough flesh. Otherwise, a
              creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
              succeed on a DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
              that the hag is disguised.
          - name: Invisible Passage

              While invisible, she leaves no physical evidence of her passage,
              so she can be tracked only by magic. Any equipment she wears or
              carries is invisible with her.

              The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
              12). She can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
              material components:


              At will: dancing lights, minor illusion, vicious mockery
          - name: Mimicry
            desc: The hag can mimic animal sounds and humanoid voices. A creature that hears
              the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 14
              Wisdom (Insight) check.
          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster

          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

              The harpy sings a magical melody. Every humanoid and giant within
              300 ft. of the harpy that can hear the song must succeed on a DC
              11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed until the song ends. The
              harpy must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns to continue
              singing. It can stop singing at any time. The song ends if the
              harpy is incapacitated.

              While charmed by the harpy, a target is incapacitated and ignores
              the songs of other harpies. If the charmed target is more than 5
              ft. away from the harpy, the must move on its turn toward the
              harpy by the most direct route. It doesn't avoid opportunity
              attacks, but before moving into damaging terrain, such as lava or
              a pit, and whenever it takes damage from a source other than the
              harpy, a target can repeat the saving throw. A creature can also
              repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If a
              creature's saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.

              A target that successfully saves is immune to this harpy's song
              for the next 24 hours.

            desc: >-
              The devil magically forms an opaque wall of ice on a solid surface
              it can see within 60 feet of it. The wall is 1 foot thick and up
              to 30 feet long and 10 feet high, or it's a hemispherical dome up
              to 20 feet in diameter.

              When the wall appears, each creature in its space is pushed out of
              it by the shortest route. The creature chooses which side of the
              wall to end up on, unless the creature is incapacitated. The
              creature then makes a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 35
              (10d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
              successful one.

              The wall lasts for 1 minute or until the devil is incapacitated or
              dies. The wall can be damaged and breached; each 10-foot section
              has AC 5, 30 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and
              immunity to acid, cold, necrotic, poison, and psychic damage. If a
              section is destroyed, it leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in
              the space the wall occupied. Whenever a creature finishes moving
              through the frigid air on a turn, willingly or otherwise, the
              creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 17
              (5d6) cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
              successful one. The frigid air dissipates when the rest of the
              wall vanishes.

              each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its master, the
              master shares the imp's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and
              for any reason, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending
              the telepathic bond.

            desc: >-
              When a creature that can see the medusa's eyes starts its turn
              within 30 ft. of the medusa, the medusa can force it to make a DC
              14 Constitution saving throw if the medusa isn't incapacitated and
              can see the creature. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the
              creature is instantly petrified. Otherwise, a creature that fails
              the save begins to turn to stone and is restrained. The restrained
              creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn,
              becoming petrified on a failure or ending the effect on a success.
              The petrification lasts until the creature is freed by the greater
              restoration spell or other magic.

              Unless surprised, a creature can avert its eyes to avoid the
              saving throw at the start of its turn. If the creature does so, it
              can't see the medusa until the start of its next turn, when it can
              avert its eyes again. If the creature looks at the medusa in the
              meantime, it must immediately make the save.

              If the medusa sees itself reflected on a polished surface within
              30 ft. of it and in an area of bright light, the medusa is, due to
              its curse, affected by its own gaze.

              possession.
          - name: Nightmare Haunting (1/Day)

              on the Material Plane. A protection from evil and good spell cast
              on the target prevents this contact, as does a magic circle. As
              long as the contact persists, the target has dreadful visions. If
              these visions last for at least 1 hour, the target gains no
              benefit from its rest, and its hit point maximum is reduced by 5
              (1d10). If this effect reduces the target's hit point maximum to
              0, the target dies, and if the target was evil, its soul is
              trapped in the hag's soul bag. The reduction to the target's hit
              point maximum lasts until removed by the greater restoration spell
              or similar magic.

              The hag's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC
              14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). She can innately cast the
              following spells, requiring no material components:


              At will: detect magic, magic missile

            desc: >-
              A night hag carries two very rare magic items that she must craft
              for herself If either object is lost, the night hag will go to
              great lengths to retrieve it, as creating a new tool takes time
              and effort.

              Heartstone: This lustrous black gem allows a night hag to become
              ethereal while it is in her possession. The touch of a heartstone
              also cures any disease. Crafting a heartstone takes 30 days.

              Soul Bag: When an evil humanoid dies as a result of a night hag's
              Nightmare Haunting, the hag catches the soul in this black sack
              made of stitched flesh. A soul bag can hold only one evil soul at
              a time, and only the night hag who crafted the bag can catch a
              soul with it. Crafting a soul bag takes 7 days and a humanoid
              sacrifice (whose flesh is used to make the bag).
          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

          **Priests** bring the teachings of their gods to the common folk. They
          are the spiritual leaders of temples and shrines and often hold
          positions of influence in their communities. Evil priests might work
          openly under a tyrant, or they might be the leaders of religious sects
          hidden in the shadows of good society, overseeing depraved rites. 

          A priest typically has one or more acolytes to help with religious
          ceremonies and other sacred duties.

              The changes wrought by this effect fail to hold up to physical
              inspection. For example, the hag could appear to have no claws,
              but someone touching her hand might feel the claws. Otherwise, a
              creature must take an action to visually inspect the illusion and
              succeed on a DC 16 Intelligence (Investigation) check to discern
              that the hag is disguised.

              Any humanoid that starts its turn within 30 feet of the hag and
              can see the hag's true form must make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.
              On a failed save, the creature is frightened for 1 minute. A
              creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
              turns, with disadvantage if the hag is within line of sight,
              ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving
              throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is
              immune to the hag's Horrific Appearance for the next 24 hours.

              Unless the target is surprised or the revelation of the hag's true
              form is sudden, the target can avert its eyes and avoid making the
              initial saving throw. Until the start of its next turn, a creature
              that averts its eyes has disadvantage on attack rolls against the
              hag.
          - name: Hag Coven
            desc: >-
              When hags must work together, they form covens, in spite of their
              selfish natures. A coven is made up of hags of any type, all of
              whom are equals within the group. However, each of the hags
              continues to desire more personal power.

              A coven consists of three hags so that any arguments between two
              hags can be settled by the third. If more than three hags ever
              come together, as might happen if two covens come into conflict,
              the result is usually chaos.
          - name: Shared Spellcasting (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              While all three members of a hag coven are within 30 feet of one
              another, they can each cast the following spells from the wizard's
              spell list but must share the spell slots among themselves:


              * 1st level (4 slots): identify, ray of sickness

              * 2nd level (3 slots): hold person, locate object

              * 3rd level (3 slots): bestow curse, counterspell, lightning bolt

              * 4th level (3 slots): phantasmal killer, polymorph

              * 5th level (2 slots): contact other plane, scrying

              * 6th level (1 slot): eye bite


              For casting these spells, each hag is a 12th-level spellcaster
              that uses Intelligence as her spellcasting ability. The spell save
              DC is 12+the hag's Intelligence modifier, and the spell attack
              bonus is 4+the hag's Intelligence modifier.
          - name: Hag Eye (Coven Only)
            desc: >-
              A hag coven can craft a magic item called a hag eye, which is made
              from a real eye coated in varnish and often fitted to a pendant or
              other wearable item. The hag eye is usually entrusted to a minion
              for safekeeping and transport. A hag in the coven can take an
              action to see what the hag eye sees if the hag eye is on the same
              plane of existence. A hag eye has AC 10, 1 hit point, and
              darkvision with a radius of 60 feet. If it is destroyed, each
              coven member takes 3d10 psychic damage and is blinded for 24
              hours.

              A hag coven can have only one hag eye at a time, and creating a
              new one requires all three members of the coven to perform a
              ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour, and the hags can't perform it
              while blinded. During the ritual, if the hags take any action
              other than performing the ritual, they must start over.

              While attached, the stirge doesn't attack. Instead, at the start
              of each of the stirge's turns, the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit
              points due to blood loss.

              The stirge can detach itself by spending 5 feet of its movement.
              It does so after it drains 10 hit points of blood from the target
              or the target dies. A creature, including the target, can use its
              action to detach the stirge.

              total cover against attacks and other effects outside the
              tarrasque, and it takes 56 (16d6) acid damage at the start of each
              of the tarrasque's turns.

              If the tarrasque takes 60 damage or more on a single turn from a
              creature inside it, the tarrasque must succeed on a DC 20

              all swallowed creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10
              feet of the tarrasque. If the tarrasque dies, a swallowed creature

              **19-20:** The troll is decapitated, but the troll dies only if it
              can't regenerate. If it dies, so does the severed head.


              If the troll finishes a short or long rest without reattaching a
              severed limb or head, the part regrows. At that point, the severed
              part dies. Until then, a severed part acts on the troll's
              initiative and has its own action and movement. A severed part has
              AC 13, 10 hit points, and the troll's Regeneration trait.

              A **severed leg** is unable to attack and has a speed of 5 feet.

              A **severed arm** has a speed of 5 feet and can make one claw
              attack on its turn, with disadvantage on the attack roll unless
              the troll can see the arm and its target. Each time the troll
              loses an arm, it loses a claw attack.

              If its head is severed, the troll loses its bite attack and its
              body is blinded unless the head can see it. The **severed head**
              has a speed of 0 feet and the troll's Keen Smell trait. It can
              make a bite attack but only against a target in its space.

              The troll's speed is halved if it's missing a leg. If it loses
              both legs, it falls prone. If it has both arms, it can crawl. With
              only one arm, it can still crawl, but its speed is halved. With no
              arms or legs, its speed is 0, and it can't benefit from bonuses to
              speed.

              17 Wisdom saving throw against this magic or be charmed by the
              vampire. The charmed target regards the vampire as a trusted
              friend to be heeded and protected. Although the target isn't under
              the vampire's control, it takes the vampire's requests or actions

              If the vampire isn't in sun light or running water, it can use its
              action to polymorph into a Tiny bat or a Medium cloud of mist, or
              back into its true form.

              While in bat form, the vampire can't speak, its walking speed is 5
              feet, and it has a flying speed of 30 feet. Its statistics, other
              than its size and speed, are unchanged. Anything it is wearing
              transforms with it, but nothing it is carrying does. It reverts to
              its true form if it dies.

              While in mist form, the vampire can't take any actions, speak, or
              manipulate objects. It is weightless, has a flying speed of 20
              feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop
              there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can
              do so without squeezing, and it can't pass through water. It has
              advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws,
              and it is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage it
              takes from sunlight.

            desc: If the vampire fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
          - name: Misty Escape
            desc: >-
              When it drops to 0 hit points outside its resting place, the
              vampire transforms into a cloud of mist (as in the Shapechanger
              trait) instead of falling unconscious, provided that it isn't in
              sunlight or running water. If it can't transform, it is destroyed.

              While it has 0 hit points in mist form, it can't revert to its
              vampire form, and it must reach its resting place within 2 hours
              or be destroyed. Once in its resting place, it reverts to its
              vampire form. It is then paralyzed until it regains at least 1 hit
              point. After spending 1 hour in its resting place with 0 hit
              points, it regains 1 hit point.
          - name: Regeneration
            desc: The vampire regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at
              least 1 hit point and isn't in sunlight or running water. If the
              vampire takes radiant damage or damage from holy water, this trait
              doesn't function at the start of the vampire's next turn.
          - name: Spider Climb
            desc: The vampire can climb difficult surfaces, including upside down on
              ceilings, without needing to make an ability check.
          - name: Vampire Weaknesses
            desc: >-
              The vampire has the following flaws:

              Dexterity saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) fire damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Sleep Breath.** The dragon exhales sleep gas in a 30-foot cone.
              Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution
              saving throw or fall unconscious for 5 minutes. This effect ends
              for a creature if the creature takes damage or someone uses an
              action to wake it.

              **Acid Breath.** The dragon exhales acid in an 40-foot line that
              is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 14
              Dexterity saving throw, taking 40 (9d8) acid damage on a failed
              save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Slowing Breath.** The dragon exhales gas in a 30-foot cone. Each
              creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving
              throw. On a failed save, the creature can't use reactions, its
              speed is halved, and it can't make more than one attack on its
              turn. In addition, the creature can use either an action or a
              bonus action on its turn, but not both. These effects last for 1
              minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
              each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a successful
              save.

              The dragon uses one of the following breath weapons.

              **Cold Breath.** The dragon exhales an icy blast in a 30-foot
              cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 17 Constitution
              saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) cold damage on a failed save, or
              half as much damage on a successful one.

              **Paralyzing Breath.** The dragon exhales paralyzing gas in a
              30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 17
              Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A creature
              can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
              ending the effect on itself on a success.
