              If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one
              Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen
              attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll
              hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt
              by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal
              Strike effect of your choice. You have the following effect
              options.


              **Forceful Blow.** The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from
              you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the
              target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.


              **Hamstring Blow.** The target's Speed is reduced by 15 feet until
              the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one
              Hamstring Blow at a time the most recent one.

              You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects
              are now among your Brutal Strike options.


              **Staggering Blow.** The target has Disadvantage on the next
              saving throw it makes, and it can't make Opportunity Attacks until
              the start of your next turn.


              **Sundering Blow.** Before the start of your next turn, the next
              attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5
              bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow
              bonus.

              minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round
              to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious
              condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy
              armor.

              In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal
              power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability
              check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a
              Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability:
              Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When
              you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power
              coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.

              You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force
              that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter
              it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.


              You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your
              Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features
              table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest,
              and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.


              While active, your Rage follows the rules below. *Damage
              Resistance.* You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and
              Slashing damage.


              **Rage Damage.** When you make an attack using Strength—with
              either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the
              target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain
              levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the
              Barbarian Features table.


              **Strength Advantage.** You have Advantage on Strength checks and
              Strength saving throws.


              **No Concentration or Spells.** You can't maintain Concentration,
              and you can't cast spells.


              **Duration.** The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and
              it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated
              condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can
              extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:

              - Make an attack roll against an enemy.

              - Force an enemy to make a saving throw.

              - Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.


              Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your
              next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.

              ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you
              can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on
              attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but
              attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.

              outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you
              succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice
              your Barbarian level.


              Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases
              by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

              detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a
              specialization that grants you features at certain Bard levels.
              For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's
              features that are of your Bard level or lower.

              You can supernaturally inspire others through words, music, or
              dance. This inspiration is represented by your Bardic Inspiration
              die, which is a d6.


              **Using Bardic Inspiration.** As a Bonus Action, you can inspire
              another creature within 60 feet of yourself who can see or hear
              you. That creature gains one of your Bardic Inspiration dice. A
              creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.


              Once within the next hour when the creature fails a D20 Test, the
              creature can roll the Bardic Inspiration die and add the number
              rolled to the d20, potentially turning the failure into a success.
              A Bardic Inspiration die is expended when it's rolled.


              **Number of Uses.** You can confer a Bardic Inspiration die a
              number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once),
              and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.


              **At Higher Levels.** Your Bardic Inspiration die changes when you
              reach certain Bard levels, as shown in the Bardic Die column of
              the Bard Features table. The die becomes a d8 at level 5, a d10 at
              level 10, and a d12 at level 15.

              You have learned to cast spells through your bardic arts. See
              "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below
              details how you use those rules with Bard spells, which appear in
              the Bard spell list later in the class's description.


              **Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Bard
              spell list. *Dancing Lights* and *Vicious Mockery* are
              recommended.


              Whenever you gain a Bard level, you can replace one of your
              cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Bard spell
              list.


              When you reach Bard levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of
              your choice from the Bard spell list, as shown in the Cantrips
              column of the Bard Features table.


              **Spell Slots.** The Bard Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all
              expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To
              start, choose four level 1 spells from the Bard spell list. *Charm
              Person*, *Color Spray*, *Dissonant Whispers*, and *Healing Word*
              are recommended.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Bard
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Bard
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              spells from the Bard spell list until the number of spells on your
              list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of
              a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a
              level 3 Bard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells
              of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.


              If another Bard feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Bard spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Bard level,
              you can replace one spell on your list with another Bard spell for
              which you have spell slots.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability
              for your Bard spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Musical Instrument as a
              Spellcasting Focus for your Bard spells.

            desc: >-
              You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to
              fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine
              Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time
              you use this class's Channel Divinity, choose which Channel
              Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional
              effect options at higher Cleric levels.


              You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of
              its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all
              expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional
              uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel
              Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.


              If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC
              equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.


              **Divine Spark.** As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at
              another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus
              divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You
              either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or
              force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a
              failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your
              choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature
              takes half as much damage (round down).


              You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13
              (3d8), and 18 (4d8).


              **Turn Undead.** As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol
              and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30
              feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails
              its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1
              minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it
              can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it
              takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if
              you die.

            desc: Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your
              Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each
              Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead
              takes Radiant damage equal to the roll's total. This damage
              doesn't end the turn effect.

            name: Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See
              "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below
              details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear
              on the Cleric spell list later in the class's description.


              **Cantrips.** You know three cantrips of your choice from the
              Cleric spell list. *Guidance*, *Sacred Flame*, and *Thaumaturgy*
              are recommended.


              Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your
              cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell
              list.


              When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip
              of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the
              Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.


              **Spell Slots.** The Cleric Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all
              expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To
              start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list.
              *Bless*, *Cure Wounds*, *Guiding Bolt*, and *Shield of Faith* are
              recommended.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on
              your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must
              be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
              you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include
              six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.


              If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Cleric spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long
              Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any
              of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have
              spell slots.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for
              your Cleric spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a
              Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

          Bards of the College of Lore collect spells and secrets from diverse
          sources, such as scholarly tomes, mystical rites, and peasant tales.
          The college's members gather in libraries and universities to share
          their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of
          state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at
          self-important figures of authority.

          Your innate magic comes from the gift of a dragon. Perhaps an ancient
          dragon facing death bequeathed some of its magical power to you or
          your ancestor. You might have absorbed magic from a site infused with
          dragons' power. Or perhaps you handled a treasure taken from a
          dragon's hoard that was steeped in draconic power. Or you might have a
          dragon for an ancestor.

              The vitality of nature constantly blooms within you, granting you
              the following benefits.


              **Evergreen Wild Shape.** Whenever you roll Initiative and have no
              uses of Wild Shape left, you regain one expended use of it.


              **Nature Magician.** You can convert uses of Wild Shape into a
              spell slot (no action required). Choose a number of your
              unexpended uses of Wild Shape and convert them into a single spell
              slot, with each use contributing 2 spell levels. For example, if
              you convert two uses of Wild Shape, you produce a level 4 spell
              slot. Once you use this benefit, you can't do so again until you
              finish a Long Rest.


              **Longevity.** The primal magic that you wield causes you to age
              more slowly. For every ten years that pass, your body ages only
              one year.

          - key: srd-2024_druid_druid-subclass
            name: Druid Subclass
            desc: You gain a Druid subclass of your choice. The Circle of the Land subclass
              is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is a
              specialization that grants you features at certain Druid levels.
              For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's
              features that are of your Druid level or lower.

            desc: >-
              You know Druidic, the secret language of Druids. While learning
              this ancient tongue, you also unlocked the magic of communicating
              with animals; you always have the *Speak with Animals* spell
              prepared.


              You can use Druidic to leave hidden messages. You and others who
              know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the
              message's presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence
              (Investigation) check but can't decipher it without magic.

              The might of the elements flows through you. You gain one of the
              following options of your choice.


              **Potent Spellcasting.** Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage
              you deal with any Druid cantrip.


              **Primal Strike.** Once on each of your turns when you hit a
              creature with an attack roll using a weapon or a Beast form's
              attack in Wild Shape, you can cause the target to take an extra
              1d8 Cold, Fire, Lightning, or Thunder damage (choose when you
              hit).

              The option you chose for Elemental Fury grows more powerful, as
              detailed below.


              **Potent Spellcasting.** When you cast a Druid cantrip with a
              range of 10 feet or greater, the spell's range increases by 300
              feet.


              **Primal Strike.** The extra damage of your Primal Strike
              increases to 2d8.

            name: Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              You have learned to cast spells through studying the mystical
              forces of nature. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The
              information below details how you use those rules with Druid
              spells, which appear on the Druid spell list later in the class's
              description.


              **Cantrips.** You know two cantrips of your choice from the Druid
              spell list. *Druidcraft* and *Produce Flame* are recommended.


              Whenever you gain a Druid level, you can replace one of your
              cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Druid spell
              list.


              When you reach Druid levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of
              your choice from the Druid spell list, as shown in the Cantrips
              column of the Druid Features table.


              **Spell Slots.** The Druid Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all
              expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To
              start, choose four level 1 spells from the Druid spell list.
              *Animal Friendship*, *Cure Wounds*, *Faerie Fire*, and
              *Thunderwave* are recommended.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Druid
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Druid
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              spells from the Druid spell list until the number of spells on
              your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must
              be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
              you're a level 3 Druid, your list of prepared spells can include
              six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.


              If another Druid feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Druid spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long
              Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any
              of the spells with other Druid spells for which you have spell
              slots.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for
              your Druid spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a
              Spellcasting Focus for your Druid spells.

              You can summon a nature spirit that assumes an animal form to aid
              you. As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of
              Wild Shape to cast the *Find Familiar* spell without Material
              components.


              When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and
              disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

              Once on each of your turns, if you have no uses of Wild Shape
              left, you can give yourself one use by expending a spell slot (no
              action required).


              In addition, you can expend one use of Wild Shape (no action
              required) to give yourself a level 1 spell slot, but you can't do
              so again until you finish a Long Rest.

            desc: >-
              The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As
              a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have
              learned for this feature (see "Known Forms" below). You stay in
              that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or
              until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition,
              or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.


              **Number of Uses.** You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one
              expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all
              expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.


              You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as
              shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.


              **Known Forms.** You know four Beast forms for this feature,
              chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge
              Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed (see "Animals" in
              "Monsters" for stat block options). The **Rat**, **Riding Horse**,
              **Spider**, and **Wolf** are recommended. Whenever you finish a
              Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another
              eligible form.


              When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms
              and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as
              shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8,
              you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.


              When choosing known forms, you may look in other sources for
              eligible Beasts if the Game Master permits you to do so.


              Table: Beast Shapes


              |Druid Level|Known Forms|Max CR|Fly Speed|

              |---|---|---|---|

              |2|4|1/4|No|

              |4|6|1/2|No|

              |8|8|1|Yes|


              **Rules While Shape-Shifted.** While in a form, you retain your
              personality, memories, and ability to speak, and the following
              rules apply:

              - **Temporary Hit Points.** When you assume a Wild Shape form, you
              gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Druid level.

              - **Game Statistics.** Your game statistics are replaced by the
              Beast's stat block, but you retain your creature type; Hit Points;
              Hit Point Dice; Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores; class
              features; languages; and feats. You also retain your skill and
              saving throw proficiencies and use your Proficiency Bonus for
              them, in addition to gaining the proficiencies of the creature. If
              a skill or saving throw modifier in the Beast's stat block is
              higher than yours, use the one in the stat block.

              - **No Spellcasting.** You can't cast spells, but shapeshifting
              doesn't break your Concentration or otherwise interfere with a
              spell you've already cast.

              - **Objects.** Your ability to handle objects is determined by the
              form's limbs rather than your own. In addition, you choose whether
              your equipment falls in your space, merges into your new form, or
              is worn by it. Worn equipment functions as normal, but the GM
              decides whether it's practical for the new form to wear a piece of
              equipment based on the creature's size and shape. Your equipment
              doesn't change size or shape to match the new form, and any
              equipment that the new form can't wear must either fall to the
              ground or merge with the form. Equipment that merges with the form
              has no effect while you're in that form.

              You can increase the power of your spells. When you cast a Wizard
              spell with a spell slot of levels 1–5 that deals damage, you can
              deal maximum damage with that spell on the turn you cast it.


              The first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use
              this feature again before you finish a Long Rest, you take 2d12
              Necrotic damage for each level of the spell slot immediately after
              you cast it. This damage ignores Resistance and Immunity.


              Each time you use this feature again before finishing a Long Rest,
              the Necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.

              Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include

              die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a
              creature with a spell, you restore 12.

          *Soothe the Hurts of the World*


          The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all
          life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters
          of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.


          Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this
          domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it.
          This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods
          of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious
          orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

              subclass is detailed after this class's description. A subclass is
              a specialization that grants you features at certain Monk levels.

            desc: >-
              Your focus and martial training allow you to harness a well of
              extraordinary energy within yourself. This energy is represented
              by Focus Points. Your Monk level determines the number of points
              you have, as shown in the Focus Points column of the Monk Features
              table.


              You can expend these points to enhance or fuel certain Monk
              features. You start knowing three such features: Flurry of Blows,
              Patient Defense, and Step of the Wind, each of which is detailed
              below.


              When you expend a Focus Point, it is unavailable until you finish
              a Short or Long Rest, at the end of which you regain all your
              expended points.


              Some features that use Focus Points require your target to make a
              saving throw. The save DC equals 8 plus your Wisdom modifier and
              Proficiency Bonus.


              **Flurry of Blows.** You can expend 1 Focus Point to make two
              Unarmed Strikes as a Bonus Action.


              **Patient Defense.** You can take the Disengage action as a Bonus
              Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both
              the Disengage and the Dodge actions as a Bonus Action.


              **Step of the Wind.** You can take the Dash action as a Bonus
              Action. Alternatively, you can expend 1 Focus Point to take both
              the Disengage and Dash actions as a Bonus Action, and your jump
              distance is doubled for the turn.

          *Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order*


          The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of justice and
          order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining
          armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and
          some—for better or worse—hold the rest of the world to the same
          standards.


          Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use
          their gods' tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others hold
          angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into
          their helmets or coats of arms.


          These paladins share the following tenets:


          - Let your word be your promise.

          - Protect the weak and never fear to act.

          - Let your honorable deeds be an example.

              Incapacitated condition.


              You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws
              equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).


              If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only
              one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura
              while in them.

            desc: >-
              You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes,
              using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect:
              Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features
              give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use
              this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this
              class to create.


              You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of
              its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all
              expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional
              use when you reach Paladin level 11.


              If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC
              equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.


              **Divine Sense.** As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness
              to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes
              or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the
              location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of
              yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius,
              you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been
              consecrated or desecrated, as with the *Hallow* spell.

              **Blessed Warrior.** You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice

              *Guidance* and *Sacred Flame* are recommended. The chosen cantrips

              number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount
              remaining in the pool.


              You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to
              remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points
              don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.

              organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's
              school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the
              spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M*
              means it requires a specific Material component.

            name: Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See
              "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below
              details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear
              in the Paladin spell list later in the class's description.


              **Spell Slots.** The Paladin Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all
              expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+**. You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To
              start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells. *Heroism* and *Searing
              Smite* are recommended.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              Paladin spells until the number of spells on your list matches the
              number in the Paladin Features table. The chosen spells must be of
              a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a
              level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six
              Paladin spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.


              If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Paladin spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long
              Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Paladin
              spell for which you have spell slots.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability
              for your Paladin spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Holy Symbol as a
              Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.

              Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery
              properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you
              have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.


              Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of
              weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the
              mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.

              As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your
              menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature
              of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must
              make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and
              Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the
              Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the
              Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending
              the effect on itself on a success.


              Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish
              a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action
              required) to restore your use of it.

          *Channel Rage into Violent Fury*


          Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage
          primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and
          they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize
          and empower them.

            name: Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast
              spells. See "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The
              information below details how you use those rules with Ranger
              spells, which appear in the Ranger spell list later in the class's
              description.


              **Spell Slots.** The Ranger Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all
              expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+**. You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To
              start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells. *Cure Wounds* and
              *Ensnaring Strike* are recommended.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              Ranger spells until the number of spells on your list matches the
              number in the Ranger Features table. The chosen spells must be of
              a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a
              level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six
              Ranger spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.


              If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Ranger spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long
              Rest, you can replace one spell on your list with another Ranger
              spell for which you have spell slots.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for
              your Ranger spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use a Druidic Focus as a
              Spellcasting Focus for your Ranger spells.

              Primal forces now help fuel you on your journeys, granting you the
              following benefits.


              **Temporary Hit Points.** As a Magic action, you can give yourself
              a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 1d8 plus your Wisdom
              modifier (minimum of 1). You can use this action a number of times
              equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain
              all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Decrease Exhaustion.** Whenever you finish a Short Rest, your
              Exhaustion level, if any, decreases by 1.

              have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.


              Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of
              weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the
              mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.

              You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you
              deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning
              Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of
              Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You
              remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately
              after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the
              Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before
              rolling.


              If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals
              8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.


              **Poison (Cost: 1d6).** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing
              the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
              the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of
              each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending
              the effect on itself on a success.


              To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner's Kit on your person.


              **Trip (Cost: 1d6).** If the target is Large or smaller, it must
              succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.


              **Withdraw (Cost: 1d6).** Immediately after the attack, you move
              up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

              **Daze (Cost: 2d6).** The target must succeed on a Constitution
              saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the
              following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.


              **Knock Out (Cost: 6d6).** The target must succeed on a
              Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for
              1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target
              repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the
              effect on itself on a success.


              **Obscure (Cost: 3d6).** The target must succeed on a Dexterity
              saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its
              next turn.

              You can tap into the wellspring of magic within yourself. This
              wellspring is represented by Sorcery Points, which allow you to
              create a variety of magical effects.


              You have 2 Sorcery Points, and you gain more as you reach higher
              levels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer
              Features table. You can't have more Sorcery Points than the number
              shown in the table for your level. You regain all expended Sorcery
              Points when you finish a Long Rest.


              You can use your Sorcery Points to fuel the options below, along
              with other features, such as Metamagic, that use those points.


              **Converting Spell Slots to Sorcery Points.** You can expend a
              spell slot to gain a number of Sorcery Points equal to the slot's
              level (no action required).


              **Creating Spell Slots.** As a Bonus Action, you can transform
              unexpended Sorcery Points into one spell slot. The Creating Spell
              Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot of a given
              level, and it lists the minimum Sorcerer level you must be to
              create a slot. You can create a spell slot no higher than level 5.


              Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you
              finish a Long Rest.

              ### Careful Spell


              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              When you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving
              throw, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell's
              full force. To do so, spend 1 Sorcery Point and choose a number of
              those creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one
              creature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving
              throw against the spell, and it takes no damage if it would
              normally take half damage on a successful save.


              ### Distant Spell


              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              When you cast a spell that has a range of at least 5 feet, you can
              spend 1 Sorcery Point to double the spell's range. Or when you
              cast a spell that has a range of Touch, you can spend 1 Sorcery
              Point to make the spell's range 30 feet.


              ### Empowered Spell


              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              When you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to
              reroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier
              (minimum of one), and you must use the new rolls. You can use
              Empowered Spell even if you've already used a different Metamagic
              option during the casting of the spell.


              ### Extended Spell


              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              When you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer,
              you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to double its duration to a maximum
              duration of 24 hours. If the affected spell requires
              Concentration, you have Advantage on any saving throw you make to
              maintain that Concentration.


              ### Heightened Spell


              *Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*


              When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving
              throw, you can spend 2 Sorcery Points to give one target of the
              spell Disadvantage on saves against the spell.


              ### Quickened Spell


              *Cost: 2 Sorcery Points*


              When you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you
              can spend 2 Sorcery Points to change the casting time to a Bonus
              Action for this casting. You can't modify a spell in this way if
              you've already cast a level 1+ spell on the current turn, nor can
              you cast a level 1+ spell on this turn after modifying a spell in
              this way.


              ### Seeking Spell


              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              If you make an attack roll for a spell and miss, you can spend 1
              Sorcery Point to reroll the d20, and you must use the new roll.
              You can use Seeking Spell even if you've already used a different
              Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.

               Subtle Spell

              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              When you cast a spell, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to cast it
              without any Verbal, Somatic, or Material components, except
              Material components that are consumed by the spell or that have a
              cost specified in the spell.


              ### Transmuted Spell


              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              When you cast a spell that deals a type of damage from the
              following list, you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to change that
              damage type to one of the other listed types: Acid, Cold, Fire,
              Lightning, Poison, Thunder.


              ### Twinned Spell


              *Cost: 1 Sorcery Point*


              When you cast a spell, such as *Charm Person*, that can be cast
              with a higher-level spell slot to target an additional creature,
              you can spend 1 Sorcery Point to increase the spell's effective
              level by 1.

              spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M*
              means it requires a specific Material component.

            name: Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              Drawing from your innate magic, you can cast spells. See "Spells"
              for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how
              you use those rules with Sorcerer spells, which appear in the
              Sorcerer spell list later in the class's description.


              **Cantrips.** You know four Sorcerer cantrips of your choice.
              *Light*, *Prestidigitation*, *Shocking Grasp*, and *Sorcerous
              Burst* are recommended. Whenever you gain a Sorcerer level, you
              can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another
              Sorcerer cantrip of your choice.


              When you reach Sorcerer levels 4 and 10, you learn another
              Sorcerer cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column
              of the Sorcerer Features table.


              **Spell Slots.** The Sorcerer Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all
              expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To
              start, choose two level 1 Sorcerer spells. *Burning Hands* and
              *Detect Magic* are recommended.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Sorcerer
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Sorcerer
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              Sorcerer spells until the number of spells on your list matches
              the number in the Sorcerer Features table. The chosen spells must
              be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if
              you're a level 3 Sorcerer, your list of prepared spells can
              include six Sorcerer spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.


              If another Sorcerer feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Sorcerer spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Sorcerer
              level, you can replace one spell on your list with another
              Sorcerer spell for which you have spell slots.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is your spellcasting ability
              for your Sorcerer spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a
              Spellcasting Focus for your Sorcerer spells.

              You've learned how to maximize use of magic items, granting you
              the following benefits.


              **Attunement.** You can attune to up to four magic items at once.


              **Charges.** Whenever you use a magic item property that expends
              charges, roll 1d6. On a roll of 6, you use the property without
              expending the charges.


              **Scrolls.** You can use any *Spell Scroll*, using Intelligence as
              your spellcasting ability for the spell. If the spell is a cantrip
              or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll
              contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an
              Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a
              successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed
              check, the scroll disintegrates.

              ### Agonizing Blast

              Damage*


              Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage. You
              can add your Charisma modifier to that spell's damage rolls.


              **Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each
              time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip.


              ### Armor of Shadows


              You can cast *Mage Armor* on yourself without expending a spell
              slot.


              ### Ascendant Step


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*


              You can cast *Levitate* on yourself without expending a spell
              slot.


              ### Devil's Sight


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*


              You can see normally in Dim Light and Darkness both magical and
              nonmagical—within 120 feet of yourself.


              ### Devouring Blade


              *Prerequisite: Level 12+ Warlock, Thirsting Blade Invocation*


              The Extra Attack of your Thirsting Blade invocation confers two
              extra attacks rather than one.


              ### Eldritch Mind


              You have Advantage on Constitution saving throws that you make to
              maintain Concentration.


              ### Eldritch Smite


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation*


              Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you
              can expend a Pact Magic spell slot to deal an extra 1d8 Force
              damage to the target, plus another 1d8 per level of the spell
              slot, and you can give the target the Prone condition if it is
              Huge or smaller.


              ### Eldritch Spear


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals
              Damage*


              Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that deals damage and
              has a range of 10+ feet. When you cast that spell, its range
              increases by a number of feet equal to 30 times your Warlock
              level.


              **Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each
              time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip.


              ### Fiendish Vigor


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*


              You can cast *False Life* on yourself without expending a spell
              slot. When you cast the spell with this feature, you don't roll
              the die for the Temporary Hit Points; you automatically get the
              highest number on the die.


              ### Gaze of Two Minds


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*


              You can use a Bonus Action to touch a willing creature and
              perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As
              long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you
              can take a Bonus Action on subsequent turns to maintain this
              connection, extending the duration until the end of your next
              turn. The connection ends if you don't maintain it in this way.


              While perceiving through the other creature's senses, you benefit
              from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you can
              cast spells as if you were in your space or the other creature's
              space if the two of you are within 60 feet of each other.


              ### Gift of the Depths


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*


              You can breathe underwater, and you gain a Swim Speed equal to
              your Speed.


              You can also cast *Water Breathing* once without expending a spell
              slot. You regain the ability to cast it in this way again when you
              finish a Long Rest.


              ### Gift of the Protectors


              *Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Tome Invocation*


              A new page appears in your *Book of Shadows* when you conjure it.
              With your permission, a creature can take an action to write its
              name on that page, which can contain a number of names equal to
              your Charisma modifier (minimum of one name).


              When any creature whose name is on the page is reduced to 0 Hit
              Points but not killed outright, the creature magically drops to 1
              Hit Point instead. Once this magic is triggered, no creature can
              benefit from it until you finish a Long Rest.


              As a Magic action, you can erase a name on the page by touching
              it.


              ### Investment of the Chain Master


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Chain Invocation*


              When you cast *Find Familiar*, you infuse the summoned familiar
              with a measure of your eldritch power, granting the creature the
              following benefits.


              **Aerial or Aquatic.** The familiar gains either a Fly Speed or a
              Swim Speed (your choice) of 40 feet.


              **Quick Attack.** As a Bonus Action, you can command the familiar
              to take the Attack action.


              **Necrotic or Radiant Damage.** Whenever the familiar deals
              Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing damage, you can make it deal
              Necrotic or Radiant damage instead.


              **Your Save DC.** If the familiar forces a creature to make a
              saving throw, it uses your spell save DC.


              **Resistance.** When the familiar takes damage, you can take a
              Reaction to grant it Resistance against that damage.


              ### **Lessons of the First Ones**


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*


              You have received knowledge from an elder entity of the
              multiverse, allowing you to gain one Origin feat of your choice
              (see "Feats").


              **Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each
              time you do so, choose a different Origin feat.


              ### Lifedrinker


              *Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation*


              Once per turn when you hit a creature with your pact weapon, you
              can deal an extra 1d6 Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage (your
              choice) to the creature, and you can expend one of your Hit Point
              Dice to roll it and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the
              roll plus your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 Hit Point).


              ### Mask of Many Faces


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*


              You can cast *Disguise Self* without expending a spell slot.


              ### Master of Myriad Forms


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*


              You can cast *Alter Self* without expending a spell slot.


              ### Misty Visions


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*


              You can cast *Silent Image* without expending a spell slot.


              ### One with Shadows


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock*


              While you're in an area of Dim Light or Darkness, you can cast
              *Invisibility* on yourself without expending a spell slot.


              ### Otherworldly Leap


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock*


              You can cast *Jump* on yourself without expending a spell slot.


              ### Pact of the Blade


              As a Bonus Action, you can conjure a pact weapon in your hand—a
              Simple or Martial Melee weapon of your choice with which you
              bond—or create a bond with a magic weapon you touch; you can't
              bond with a magic weapon if someone else is attuned to it or
              another Warlock is bonded with it. Until the bond ends, you have
              proficiency with the weapon, and you can use it as a Spellcasting
              Focus.


              Whenever you attack with the bonded weapon, you can use your
              Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls instead of using
              Strength or Dexterity; and you can cause the weapon to deal
              Necrotic, Psychic, or Radiant damage or its normal damage type.


              Your bond with the weapon ends if you use this feature's Bonus
              Action again, if the weapon is more than 5 feet away from you for
              1 minute or more, or if you die. A conjured weapon disappears when
              the bond ends.


              ### Pact of the Chain


              You learn the *Find Familiar* spell and can cast it as a Magic
              action without expending a spell slot.


              When you cast the spell, you choose one of the normal forms for
              your familiar or one of the following special forms: **Imp,
              Pseudodragon, Quasit, Skeleton, Sphinx of Wonder, Sprite,** or
              **Venomous Snake** (see "Monsters" for the familiar's stat block).


              Additionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one
              of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of
              its own with its Reaction.


              ### Pact of the Tome


              Stitching together strands of shadow, you conjure forth a book in
              your hand at the end of a Short or Long Rest. This *Book of
              Shadows* (you determine its appearance) contains eldritch magic
              that only you can access, granting you the benefits below. The
              book disappears if you conjure another book with this feature or
              if you die.


              **Cantrips and Rituals.** When the book appears, choose three
              cantrips, and choose two level 1 spells that have the Ritual tag.
              The spells can be from any class's spell list, and they must be
              spells you don't already have prepared. While the book is on your
              person, you have the chosen spells prepared, and they function as
              Warlock spells for you.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use the book as a Spellcasting
              Focus.


              ### Repelling Blast


              *Prerequisite: Level 2+ Warlock, a Warlock Cantrip That Deals
              Damage via an Attack Roll*


              Choose one of your known Warlock cantrips that requires an attack
              roll. When you hit a Large or smaller creature with that cantrip,
              you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from you.


              **Repeatable.** You can gain this invocation more than once. Each
              time you do so, choose a different eligible cantrip.


              ### Thirsting Blade


              *Prerequisite: Level 5+ Warlock, Pact of the Blade Invocation*


              You gain the Extra Attack feature for your pact weapon only. With
              that feature, you can attack twice with the weapon instead of once
              when you take the Attack action on your turn.


              ### Visions of Distant Realms


              *Prerequisite: Level 9+ Warlock*


              You can cast *Arcane Eye* without expending a spell slot.


              ### Whispers of the Grave


              *Prerequisite: Level 7+ Warlock*


              You can cast *Speak with Dead* without expending a spell slot.


              ### Witch Sight


              *Prerequisite: Level 15+ Warlock*


              You have Truesight with a range of 30 feet.

              You have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, pieces of forbidden
              knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability or other
              lessons. You gain one invocation of your choice, such as Pact of
              the Tome. Invocations are described in the "Eldritch Invocation
              Options" section later in this class's description.


              **Prerequisites.** If an invocation has a prerequisite, you must
              meet it to learn that invocation. For example, if an invocation
              requires you to be a level 5+ Warlock, you can select the
              invocation once you reach Warlock level 5.


              **Replacing and Gaining Invocations.** Whenever you gain a Warlock
              level, you can replace one of your invocations with another one
              for which you qualify. You can't replace an invocation if it's a
              prerequisite for another invocation that you have.


              When you gain certain Warlock levels, you gain more invocations of
              your choice, as shown in the Invocations column of the Warlock
              Features table.


              You can't pick the same invocation more than once unless its
              description says otherwise.

              You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell
              slot, and you must finish a Long Rest before you can cast it in
              this way again.


              As shown in the Warlock Features table, you gain another Warlock
              spell of your choice that can be cast in this way when you reach
              Warlock levels 13 (level 7 spell), 15 (level 8 spell), and 17
              (level 9 spell). You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when
              you finish a Long Rest.


              Whenever you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your
              arcanum spells with another Warlock spell of the same level.

            name: Pact Magic
            desc: >-
              Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious
              entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the
              shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the
              ability to cast spells. See "Spells" for the rules on
              spellcasting. The information below details how you use those
              rules with Warlock spells, which appear in the Warlock spell list
              later in the class's description.


              **Cantrips.** You know two Warlock cantrips of your choice.
              *Eldritch Blast* and *Prestidigitation* are recommended. Whenever
              you gain a Warlock level, you can replace one of your cantrips
              from this feature with another Warlock cantrip of your choice.


              When you reach Warlock levels 4 and 10, you learn another Warlock
              cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the
              Warlock Features table.


              **Spell Slots.** The Warlock Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your Warlock spells of levels 1–5. The
              table also shows the level of those slots, all of which are the
              same level. You regain all expended Pact Magic spell slots when
              you finish a Short or Long Rest.


              For example, when you're a level 5 Warlock, you have two level 3
              spell slots. To cast the level 1 spell *Charm Person*, you must
              spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a level 3 spell.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To
              start, choose two level 1 Warlock spells. *Charm Person* and *Hex*
              are recommended.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Warlock
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Warlock
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              Warlock spells until the number of spells on your list matches the
              number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level no
              higher than what's shown in the table's Slot Level column for your
              level. When you reach level 6, for example, you learn a new
              Warlock spell, which can be of levels 1–3.


              If another Warlock feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Warlock spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you gain a Warlock
              level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Warlock
              spell of an eligible level.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Charisma is the spellcasting ability for
              your Warlock spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus as a
              Spellcasting Focus for your Warlock spells.

              This section presents the Warlock spell list. The spells are
              organized by spell level and then alphabetized, and each spell's
              school of magic is listed. In the Special column, *C* means the
              spell requires Concentration, *R* means it's a Ritual, and *M*
              means it requires a specific Material component.

              start of its next turn.

              pushed up to 15 feet away from you.

              You gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in someone's
              body. When you hit a creature with an Unarmed Strike, you can
              expend 4 Focus Points to start these imperceptible vibrations,
              which last for a number of days equal to your Monk level. The
              vibrations are harmless unless you take an action to end them.
              Alternatively, when you take the Attack action on your turn, you
              can forgo one of the attacks to end the vibrations. To end them,
              you and the target must be on the same plane of existence. When
              you end them, the target must make a Constitution saving throw,
              taking 10d12 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage
              on a successful one.


              You can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at
              a time. You can end the vibrations harmlessly (no action
              required).

              You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom

              You can regain some of your magical energy by studying your
              spellbook. When you finish a Short Rest, you can choose expended
              spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level
              equal to no more than half your Wizard level (round up), and none
              of the slots can be level 6 or higher. For example, if you're a
              level 4 Wizard, you can recover up to two levels' worth of spell
              slots, regaining either one level 2 spell slot or two level 1

              You have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can
              cast them at will. Choose a level 1 and a level 2 spell in your
              spellbook that have a casting time of an action. You always have
              those spells prepared, and you can cast them at their lowest level
              without expending a spell slot. To cast either spell at a higher
              level, you must expend a spell slot.


              Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can study your spellbook and
              replace one of those spells with an eligible spell of the same
              level from the book.

            name: Spellcasting
            desc: >-
              As a student of arcane magic, you have learned to cast spells. See
              "Spells" for the rules on spellcasting. The information below
              details how you use those rules with Wizard spells, which appear
              in the Wizard spell list later in the class's description.


              **Cantrips.** You know three Wizard cantrips of your choice.
              *Light*, *Mage Hand*, and *Ray of Frost* are recommended. Whenever
              you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from
              this feature with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.


              When you reach Wizard levels 4 and 10, you learn another Wizard
              cantrip of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips column of the
              Wizard Features table.


              **Spellbook.** Your wizardly apprenticeship culminated in the
              creation of a unique book: your spellbook. It is a Tiny object
              that weighs 3 pounds, contains 100 pages, and can be read only by
              you or someone casting *Identify*. You determine the book's
              appearance and materials, such as a gilt-edged tome or a
              collection of vellum bound with twine.


              The book contains the level 1+ spells you know. It starts with six
              level 1 Wizard spells of your choice. *Detect Magic*, *Feather
              Fall*, *Mage Armor*, *Magic Missile*, *Sleep*, and *Thunderwave*
              are recommended.


              Whenever you gain a Wizard level after 1, add two Wizard spells of
              your choice to your spellbook. Each of these spells must be of a
              level for which you have spell slots, as shown in the Wizard
              Features table. The spells are the culmination of arcane research
              you do regularly.


              **Spell Slots.** The Wizard Features table shows how many spell
              slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all
              expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.


              **Prepared Spells of Level 1+.** You prepare the list of level 1+
              spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To do
              so, choose four spells from your spellbook. The chosen spells must
              be of a level for which you have spell slots.


              The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Wizard
              levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Wizard
              Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional
              Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the
              number in the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for
              which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3
              Wizard, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of
              levels 1 and 2 in any combination, chosen from your spellbook.


              If another Wizard feature gives you spells that you always have
              prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells
              you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise
              count as Wizard spells for you.


              **Changing Your Prepared Spells.** Whenever you finish a Long
              Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any
              of the spells there with spells from your spellbook.


              **Spellcasting Ability.** Intelligence is your spellcasting
              ability for your Wizard spells.


              **Spellcasting Focus.** You can use an Arcane Focus or your
              spellbook as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.


              > ### Expanding and Replacing a Spellbook


              > The spells you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect
              your ongoing magical research, but you might find other spells
              during your adventures that you can add to the book. You could
              discover a Wizard spell on a *Spell Scroll*, for example, and then
              copy it into your spellbook.


              >**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a level 1+
              Wizard spell, you can copy it into your spellbook if it's of a
              level you can prepare and if you have time to copy it. For each
              level of the spell, the transcription takes 2 hours and costs 50
              GP. Afterward you can prepare the spell like the other spells in
              your spellbook.


              > **Copying the Book.** You can copy a spell from your spellbook
              into another book. This is like copying a new spell into your
              spellbook but faster, since you already know how to cast the
              spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 GP for each level of the
              copied spell.


              > If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to
              transcribe the Wizard spells that you have prepared into a new
              spellbook. Filling out the remainder of the new book requires you
              to find new spells to do so. For this reason, many wizards keep a
              backup spellbook.
